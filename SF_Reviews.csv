Their place is very clean and comfortable and has everything you could need. The apartment is near to some good Asian restaurants. The apartment itself is in a quiet and calm neighborhood."
"2","21334",32876230,"463748565879075733",3,4,"Stayed over a week","This place is pure magic, straight out of a mystery novel. While it was not the most cleanly, it has bountiful charm in all its secret nooks and knickknacks. Joe himself is very kind, accommodating, and helpful.<br/>Choose this place if you want to add to the enigmatic history of a well-loved wooden loft. Note that the hill is super steep to get to the front door and, once inside, the ladder to the bed is not for the inflexible. If you don't mind a very lived-in space, give Joe's place a try. The view out the back window is also beautiful. Feels like living in some treehouse-schooner-cabin. I especially recommend if you're a creative solo traveler looking for some atmospheric inspiration."

We loved being able to glimpse into an artist's workspace from the windows of the loft.<br/>The space is very attractive, spacious and clean. Definitely a lot to enjoy within the loft with the furniture pieces, fine art, reclaimed bowling alley wood, a comfortable bed, great shower and garden views.<br/>The location worked well for exploring all the street art in the Mission District and the restaurants. There is a super nice grocery store one block away, Gus's.<br/>Florencia gave us great tips on restaurants nearby as well as how everything worked in the loft.<br/>We will long remember our stay here!"

We were there for a month and found it super easy to work from home and to get around town. The space is really stunning with huge sliding glass doors that open to a lovely back yard. The kitchen was a dream to cook in - literally anything you needed to cook was in that kitchen! We loved walking into town for baked goods at Noe Valley Bakery or coffee at Martha & Bros. We walked up to the Mission a bunch of times and got our nature fix at nearby Billy Goat Hill and Glen Canyon Park. The house is truly in a great location. Also cannot say enough nice things about the hosts, Andy and Tanya. They were a joy to communicate with!"

"28","6985131",375820946,"464477936579587783",3,5,"Stayed over a week","Grace is a great host! The living situation was perfect. I had as much privacy as needed for working from home, we hardly bumped into each other. The kitchenette set up had everything that I needed. Ingleside might not be as central to a lot of the popular areas in San Francisco on tourists lists but I thought the area was great. Plenty of tasty restaurants, gyms, and shops. Grace gave me some great recommendations for all of the above 3 types of spaces. A short drive to several surf spots. You won’t need to buy a temporary parking pass if you stay here long term as there is plenty of street parking if you know where to look. Grace is very accommodating as long as you communicate, per se she gave me designated spots for all of my surf gear. The Neighborhood is super quiet. I would 100% Airbnb this room again"

Took us a minute to get to know the neighborhood but it ended up being close to so many restaurants, bars, etc. Felt safe in the neighborhood. Little touches like an extra towel would have been super nice. Ran into a snafu which Ari was apologetic about and quick to resolve.

The location is fantastic. Lafayette Park and Pac Heights are beautiful and it’s a very short walk to Whole Foods and Polk St.  It’s also no further than a 15 minute walk to shopping and restaurants on Fillmore, Union and Chestnut. Russian Hill and the Marina areas are close as well. Easy, quick Uber/Lyft rides to Union Square and the southern areas of the city—even Marin County across the Golden Gate Bridge is a quick 15-25 minutes depending on traffic. The wifi is great—I ended up working from there more than expected and had excellent connectivity. The cleaning service is great and the laundry quite convenient. Jay’s place is a perfect introduction to the city."

It was located near the Noe center where we enjoyed the shops and wonderful restaurants  (where we appreciated the outdoor dining and strict Covid rules for indoor dining). It was a huge plus having a washer and dryer for our one month stay. We were in San Francisco to meet our newborn Granddaughter and this was the perfect place for us."

It had a lot of really thoughtful touches, such as live flowers. It’s also very close to amazing parks with panoramic views of the city (Tank Hill and Twin Peaks). It’s also walkable to the Castro, Cole Valley, and Noe Valley, which all have great coffee shops and restaurants. David is such a welcoming host, as are his sweet cats Jake and Finn.

The view from the deck is amazing, and the shared spaces are great! Jason is great to chat with and very helpful regarding the local neighborhoods. There is tremendous value in utilizing the public transportation from this Airbnb! The bus stops right in front of the house and will take you to Castro, Mission, Golden Gate Park, and more! You can take the bus right to the Bart for easy access to the rest of the city as well! The house is up two flights of stairs, and as such you get a great view of the city and the home is very safe! I had no issue with the stairs and I definitely would’ve stayed longer."

He is always asking about how to improve his place for your comfort. There is no lack of fantastic stories from him and the conversations are always super insightful whether it be for the city or a looking glass of the city’s past. I’d suggest staying 9 days, you really get to know the host, the house, and the area. Couldn’t have asked for a better place to escape to!"

I even went further to confirm that he understood my reservation and timing, as I was traveling from the east coast and wanted him to be well aware that my flight would be getting in very late. To which he then confirmed that it would be """"""""ok"""""""" and went ahead and reserved my stay. So, it was not only surprising to find another couple in the room once I arrived but HIGHLY frustrating seeing as it was nearly 1:30 in the morning!  (oh and he requested that I let him know when I was omw once I got off the plane, which I did. like I stated I knew it would be a late arrival) Not to mention that the code he gave me worked. So imagine using your """"""""own"""""""" code but then walking in and someone is sitting there in their boxers!! He was startled! I was alarmed! IT WAS DANGEROUS no matter how you view it. <br/>I immediately began contacting the """"""""superhost"""""""" via phone and messaging to which he NEVER responded. Not only did he NEVER respond, he had the audacity to contact Airbnb and blame me, telling them that he WOULD NOT REFUND me because """"""""it was my fault"""""""" and even went further, telling the bnb rep that oh """"""""well she found accommodations. """""""" YOU """""""" superhost"""""""" had NO idea what I had to do at now 2AM! I WOUND UP HAVING TO SLEEP IN MY CAR!! How dare you try to justify because you """"""""thought"""""""" I found accommodations! How could you think anything if you never even contacted me to find out if everything was ok!?! <br/>I respond bk to the Airbnb, explaining everything to the rep and providing PROOF, to which the rep then agreed that YES, IT WAS THE HOST FAULT.  <br/>So, not only did this """"""""superhost"""""""" not reach out, respond, check-in or communicate when there was CLEARLY a situation (one that could have easily went left). You lie on a paying customer & refuse to issue a refund! And you want to be seen as """"""""superhost"""""""" when not even PROFESSIONAL! <br/>Airbnb had to provide credit because the host couldn't admit to his OWN MISTAKE! I wanted MY REFUND and I DESERVED THAT!<br/>It is a SHAME that Airbnb doesn't hold their host more accountable, even and ESPECIALLY when they are in the wrong! <br/>WORSE BNB EXPERIENCE EVER!!"

The BnB is just a stone's throw from Geary Blvd, the City's main east-west artery, yet we always found parking right in front or across the street and the area was very quiet. We were a few minutes' walk to beaches, sunset views, and tons of open space, though just enjoying the garden is a wonderful way to pass the time!

The two bedroom apartment gave us a lot of space which we needed as I was working part of the time.  I loved the wrap around deck and the view of the city and the water.  The location was great.  Really close to the piers.  Just a few minutes walk to the restaurants, Pier 39, etc.  Anything that might catch someone off guard, we were expecting so no surprises.  This is a single apartment on top of a very old motel (Wharf Inn).  There really isn't much of a lobby and we communicated with the staff through a window.  Not an issue and they were always helpful.  The parking was easy and behind a secured gate that was closed at night.  Super convenient that National Car Rental is right next door.  The elevators require a card go up to the third floor The stairwell to the apartment is right next to it, so you walk up one more flight and you are at your front door.  The apartment itself was good for us.  It was updated but still felt aged.  Lots of windows.  The AC is a portable unit in the living room.  My family is really picky about AC and we were fine.  There is one bathroom with both a tub and shower.  <br/>The deck wraps around three sides of the apartment.  It primarily overlooks Mason street which is a side street so you may see homeless.  That's just Fishermans Wharf these days.  You can see the hills of the city with Coit Tower, the Transamerica building, etc.  Look the other way and you can see the water.  You are on a roof top so there is roof on one side of you but I liked the deck and sitting out there looking at the view.  Loved having the 7-11 right across the street.  Made it easy to grab stuff quickly.<br/>All in all, this place worked great for us.  Thought it was a great value.  Its so much nicer to have a living room, dining room, and kitchen for family gathering versus multiple hotel rooms."

I thought that the house was extremely clean and exactly what I expected based on the pictures. Additionally, though it is a shared space, the room itself still feels quite private, and sharing the bathroom/kitchen is easy, in case this is something that concerns you.<br/>Nancy is incredibly friendly and works very hard to make her guests feel welcome. When I arrived, she provided fresh towels, complimentary tea, and space in the fridge for me to keep my groceries. She was also kind and easy to approach with any questions.<br/>I stayed for over 2 weeks and never ran into any significant problem. Her dog Santa is calm and friendly, so even if you are not a dog person, you should not be too concerned. The listing says that sometimes the space can be noisy, but I never noticed any major level of noise. The location is convenient, a peaceful neighborhood with a Safeway and Walgreens just a couple blocks away.<br/>The only thing I would say is that sometimes the room can get a bit chilly, but I suppose that that's just San Francisco. If you dress accordingly, there shouldn't be anything to worry about.<br/>Overall, I don't have anything negative to say and can assure you that the description of the space is accurate.

Parking really is available nearby, if you have been wise enough to bring a vehicle that is not very long.   WiFi is very fast.<br/>Close to the ocean, so the neighborhood  can be foggier than more inland locations.<br/>Note that one the layout is a little unusual.  Three of the bedrooms have doors into the hallway, but the fourth bedroom can only be reached by going through either of two other bedrooms.  That can work for families or other intimates, but might be a bit awkward for some parties.<br/>I would certainly return to this flat if I again host a large group in San Francisco."

For us, the location was also ideal.  It’s in a residential neighborhood where it felt safe walking our granddog that we brought back with us at night.  It’s a short drive to the airport or into the city, and we loved having easy access to the beach, Fort Funston, the SF Zoo, and Lake Mercer.    We also were pleased with the proximity of two shopping centers that had anything one might need for an extended stay.  Finding the kitchen so well equipped and both Whole Foods and Trader Joe’s within easy walking distance, I was able to bake a traditional family birthday cake in the well designed and equipped kitchen.  However, I had forgotten to pick up parchment paper and Eric graciously offered some he had on hand!  He and Peter were especially accommodating and thoughtful hosts, and the generous fruit bowl and other food items they stocked in the kitchen were most appreciated.  We felt very fortunate that the dates we needed were available, and we look forward to returning."

The one issue we had was we were in room 3 which is on the bottom/parking lot level and WOAH is it LOUD. We barely could sleep due to the amount of traffic that parking lot gets throughout the night and on top of it the tenants above us were either line dancing or bowling ALL night. ALL NIGHT.

The kitchenette and bath are new. For our stay a number of items common in ARBNBs were missing. Such as pillows and a comforter for the second futon bed. The bathroom was not stocked properly - the shampoo in the bath/shower was empty and there was no body wash. I had to use the hand soap from the sink when I took the first shower of our stay.  When I contacted Maury she was very nice and quickly brought the missing items and a one use body wash with the promise she’d bring a full one later. It never was provided. Her sharing that the hand soap usage might result in dry skin was curious. Also there is a nice rain shower head in the bath/shower but the floor of the tub is incredible slippery when wet. The hosts should put a non slip mat in it. I had to carefully use the walls to balance myself to make sure I didn’t slip and fall. Also I wanted to watch a bit of the cable only baseball playoffs but evidently only local channels were available. I had my son also try and see if cable was provided but if it was we couldn’t figure out how to access it. Also the freezer in the mini fridge is in need of defrosting. I share my home on ARBNB as well. If you are planning to rent this unit I advise you review these points with Maury before arriving, double check the bath items are there upon arrival so you aren’t left hunting for stuff.  She has a young child with another on the way. Her plate is obviously full but if your going to make $$$ from guests for a one room unit for up to 4 people, basics need be provided. It’s fundamental!!  Then reviews like this aren’t left!"

Both the bed and the futon were very comfortable and the shower in the bathroom was spacious and clean. Fully stocked kitchen with bountiful kitchenware. Everything was thoughtfully placed -- you could tell right away that the owners were very meticulous in ensuring that the space provided everything a group of guests needed to be comfortable for a cozy weekend.<br/>Also the garden was amazing! The first night in we cooked and made a salad with most of the ingredients straight from the front yard. We also made pasta sauce from the tomatoes we picked from Carol's home-grown garden which ended up tasting very fresh, saucy and sweet. On Sunday Dave and Carol baked some blueberry scones and shared them with us (along with fresh eggs and butter) and they were DELICIOUS! What a pleasant stay - we would not hesitate to come back again in the future. I'd recommend The Roost to anyone. Thank you so, so much Dave and Carol!"

"579","24629308",19801219,"481858250371932098",3,1,"Group trip","Hi all! This is my first time writing a review and I really wish it could be a positive one. The listing says the property is owned by Duane, but I was dealing with someone named Katia. The pros: Katia was accessible by phone and the place was beautiful on the outside. The cons: First of all, they have a long list of rules which can only be described as excessive, including writing rules about not having sex on the property, which was bizarre as I was leasing this for an executive event. They feature a lovely looking kitchen in the photos, but do not want anyone to cook in the kitchen as they fear it will put oil in the air; it took a modicum of convincing that they'd allow us to have a professional chef to come in and cook, and remove the trash after. They did not show this in the photos, but there is a thin piece of unattached plywood at the bottom of the stairs that """"""""sections"""""""" off the bottom tenants and those who'd access this space. One of their wifi systems did not work and their Sonos sound system did not work. During dinner and dessert around 8 pm or 9 pm at night they called and texted everyone saying there was excessively loud music which was not true as this was 3 folks in their 40's and 50's have dinner conversation that was only slightly louder than music playing on a low/soft setting on an iPhone; the issue may be that they don't have a proper barrier between the two apartments and so even soft noise could filter down; Katia violated the law as in CA to complain at all, as we have until 10 pm to play music and they can only ask us to turn it down if heard at a certain decibel a certain number of feet outside the premises, which was NOT the case. When our chef was loading her car neighbors texted photos that we left the door open and Katia then texted us the photos, which was creepy as heck; it was necessary to leave the door open when carrying large kitchen items; there was no need to text us about it, and the door was only open a few minutes. Ultimately it became uncomfortable for us to stay there and it was mutual as Katia was worked up about an imaginary infraction of loud music being played, so they allowed us to leave early and refunded us for the night we did not stay. However, Katia told me that since we got a refund, she asked that I not leave a review. I don't think the two correlate and I did not agree to those terms but was surprised she tried to bribe me not to give honest feedback about our less than ideal stay here. She then took pictures of used towels and dirt- there was a horrible rainstorm and we used towels- and she tried to allege we brought animals into the premises. I have no idea what she was talking about, but obviously if you stay here you are not allowed to accidentally track in even the slightest dirt or use their towels to clean off. We have to pay a cleaning fee via this site, and we asked the chef to clean up the kitchen, there is not more we could have done short of cleaning before a cleaner came. The irony is the place was NOT clean when we arrived, especially the stove was disgusting inside and we had to do a deep clean before we could use it. They are so worried we might use a towel or their kitchen but they did not provide a clean kitchen or deeply cleaned space to us. Overall, they were difficult to deal with and bizarre in how they interact with clients. I got the feeling they are not allowed or authorized to list this space and that is why they have so many rules and act so secretive.  This is also one more con to note- they do not have an AV set up for a business meeting, but since they didn't advertise this I can't hold it against them, it's just a general con if you'd like to hold a business meeting here."

Though we did not have a good experience staying here. The apartment itself is a bit smaller than what the photos appear and the bathroom is positively tiny. What I was truly shocked by though was Kepa’s communication where she threatened to throw our belongings out. My parents were staying at her apartment for a few days and we had requested a late check out. She clearly said this wasn’t possible and kindly offered to store bags instead. I acknowledged this via written communication - however, she reiterated that a late check out was not possible to my mother in person again and made the offer to store bags. To which my mother responded “we’ll see” (ie, she was not sure if she needed to store bags and responded “we’ll see” to storing bags with Kepa) and ended the conversation there. Kepa interpreted this as her not willing to check out at 11 am (instead of storing bags) and sent me a threat via message saying their belongings will be removed at 11 am sharp if they do not check out and that she cannot be “talked back to” (referring to the innocent interaction with my mother). I am still very shocked by this behavior - especially from a super host. 30+ airbnb experiences around the world and I’ve never encountered this before. I hope she treats her other guests with more respect and consideration."

And within walking distance of the apartment is a lovely trail with some truly majestic views of San Francisco bay.<br/>Communication with the hosts was mostly through the Airbnb app. Todd responded extremely promptly.

This made us uncomfortable, so I texted Lisa about it. Lisa told us the next day that she had washed the sheets after the most recent """"""""human"""""""" guest, but the comforters/duvet hadn't been washed since a week. This was really concerning for us. I did feel this feedback wasn't taken well, but we remained cordial and me and my cousin spent most of our time outside of the home sightseeing. For us the situation felt uncomfortable and even when we left Lisa didn't say anything before we exited the home, even though she would before ask us when we were leaving and when we would be coming back on the prior day (because apparently she wanted to lock up after us, even though there is an independent system to enter/exit the home for Airbnb guest).

Every detail is thoughtful and intentional to ensure a comfortable and relaxing stay for the guest. By the end of my two week stay, I felt as if Mark and I had been life long friends. <br/>The room I stayed in was cozy, clean and had a great view of the city. I loved having my bathroom connected to my room for privacy. He was very generous in sharing meals and fresh fruit, and always had the coffee maker ready for me each morning. The location in the Mission was fantastic, some nights I would just stroll around the city, walking in and out of shops on Valencia. So many great restaurants and bakeries only steps away, it was hard to choose!! I look forward to staying at Mark's place again when I am back in SF.

As we were approaching our destination for the first time, the last few block every turn goes uphill & the higher we get, the nicer the homes. The street is on the top of this hill with beautiful views at every turn. It was so much quieter than surrounding areas that little elevation puts you just perfectly above the city & out of the hustle and bustle. Everything gets quiet clean and serene once you get the their street, it was the nicest thing about my stay, the location. <br/> <br/>During our stay We walked a lot (Lyft is v expensive). The hill is totally manageable going up to the house & down into the city. We had a late dinner with friends who live there & even took the walk back after 2am & felt safe the whole walk (i had pepper spray just in case lol). GPS tells you to walk through Buena Vista park, which is a great/beautiful shortcut in the day, but there are no lights at night & it’s probably a good idea to stay out of there at night. <br/>They have a backyard. In SF. It’s totally private & protected from the street. There are views. & heaters. <br/>Which brings me to the visiting cat. I can’t be the only one who mentions it. Whenever you need some animal therapy or extra love, just go out back and call for the kitty & She’ll appear from the neighboring yard or maybe from heaven idk, but for me, that’s a mic drop amenity.<br/>I won’t stay anywhere else in SF ever again. <br/>For everything mentioned even before the cat, (for the non-animal lovers) I don’t want to stay anywhere else in SF again. This is the one for my husband and I (who enjoyed it just as much, possibly even more, than me)."

Location is great being next to plenty of bars, restaurants, and even a liquor store. <br/>The people behind the front desk are really nice and helpful. <br/>The room is clean and has all that you need from a mini fridge and a microwave.<br/>My only downside which I understand can be quite expensive to do, is that if you’re staying multiple nights, house keeping doesn’t tidy up the room when you’re gone throughout the day. It would be great if they could switch out the towels and restock on toilet paper. But you get what you pay for because Pacific Inn is probably one of the cheapest around. <br/>That’s why I didn’t give the place a 5 out 5.<br/>Overall, great place to stay for the price and nearby locations!

"751","1201159",421382010,"486292944291567169",4,5,"Stayed over a week","This place and its host are both amazing. As others have written, the view is fantastic and the place itself is well-equipped, so I won't write about those. I'll talk about a few other things. <br/>* Location: It's very centrally located. E.g., It is a 10 minutes walk from major museums (SFMOMA, MOAD), 15 minutes walk from Oracle Park (Giants stadium), 15 minutes walk from Market Street and BART, and a short bus ride to Chase Center (Warriors). Several restaurants nearby within walking distance (including southeast on 3rd street, just after the freeway underpass), including some highly rated ones (and one of my favs was a nearby bakery). <br/>* About the host: Many hosts are leave you alone. And Omid is exactly that. Unless you have an issue (of any kind) - then Omid responds really quickly and works really hard to fix the issue. He went above and beyond during my stay. Absolutely fantastic host (and a great human being!).<br/>* Fob access: during my stay, the condo building moved from using key fob access to using an app for front door and elevator access. Access to the actual condo itself is still via key. The transition from fob to app was very smooth for me! <br/>* Inside the building and unit: If you're staying for a long time, the neighbors in the building are friendly, but not intrusive. The walls don't let much sound through, neither from neighbors nor from outside. The condo is fairly quiet (unless you have construction going on in nearby buildings). The condo faces away from the freeway, and there are no buildings right next to it on the Rizal side, which makes it quiet.<br/>The laundry is just a few doors down, and while it's shared with others on the same floor, I rarely ran into anyone else when I was doing my laundry. Laundry is through a convenient app.<br/>The balcony is shared, but you have it to yourself -- I saw the neighbors on only 1 day (weekend) in my 1 month stay there.<br/>The kitchen is well stocked and just right for 1 person to cook in (I cooked frequently). <br/>* Overall a fantastic place, truly fabulous location, and great value for money. If I had to stay in SOMA again, I'd choose this place."

Hotel like feel and fairly priced. <br/>I enjoyed my stay at Rebecca’s place. The apartment had a hotel feel. I’ve lived in SF for 4 years, and stayed here to finish a project after my lease ended. Very comfortable, convenient and private!  If you have a car, choose this option!  Other Airbnbs will claim there is “free street parking,” but there are few areas where this is actually true (they do exist though).<br/>Rebecca was a responsive host and answered any and all questions I had. Check in and check out was a breeze. I even had to leave early due to a family emergency - Rebecca was super sweet and helpful. <br/>Pros:<br/>- Apartment has all amenities needed for a long term stay!!!<br/>- Parking garage is super convenient <br/>- Washer and dryer inside apartment<br/>- Fabulous view of city and civic center <br/>- Full Bathroom<br/>- Very quiet<br/>- Very private <br/>- Penthouse suite<br/>- PLENTY of storage for clothes and toiletries <br/>- Fully stocked kitchen with everything you need for cooking<br/>- Rooftop deck with great views, seating, and a BBQ<br/>- Central location <br/>- CVS across the street, Whole Foods Nearby, and decent restaurants very close<br/>- Walking distance to many public transportation options including main bus lines, MUNI, and BART<br/>- Heating<br/>- No AC but fans available <br/>- Blackout curtains <br/>- Well maintained building<br/>- Convenient for deliveries (food, package, and USPS). <br/>Cons:<br/>- The apartment is located on the outskirts of the tenderloin so it’s a bit tenderloiny. Homeless people are not camping outside your door, but you will see some homeless folks from time to time.  This is a common problem in SF and not just in this area. Overall the apartment is safe, but be weary of walking around alone at night."

"853","48905854",31938306,"489903510469813419",4,3,"Stayed one night","I've stayed in a lot of Airbnbs. This was definitely not the best Airbnb I've stayed in, but it also wasn't the worst. My wife and I visited together for a single night before an event early in the morning in San Jose. Here are some pros and cons for this listing:<br/>Pros:<br/>* The listing interior is nicely designed, as the listing photos show, with nice furniture and two high quality TVs. The space is very functional.<br/>* It was nice that there was a private parking space associated with the listing.<br/>* When we had issues during check-in, Ann was very quick to message back with helpful instructions. Communication in general was quite easy.<br/>* The bed was reasonably comfortable. <br/>* The location is pretty good, with good access to the highway in particular. <br/>* The price was pretty reasonable.<br/>* The listing was fairly clean. It didn't feel hotel-level clean to me, but it was clean enough. <br/>Cons: <br/>* There is a *very* steep transition from the street to the driveway to get into the parking lot for the listing. I have a Hyundai hatchback and it loudly crashed against the curb every time we drove away from the listing. I was seriously worried I was going to damage my car each time. I would not recommend this listing unless you have a big car that sits high off the ground.<br/>* The listing was fairly drafty inside. It was cold the night we stayed there, and it was pretty cold inside as a result. I can imagine the reverse, that it gets very hot in the summer, as well.<br/>* We found the check-in instructions pretty confusing. There were no pictures of the outside of the listing on the listing page or the check-in guide. It was not super obvious how to find the listing's parking space, and we accidentally went to the wrong one first. There were conflicting instructions about the parking space in the check-in guide and the host's message to us. (Just a typo, I believe, but still confusing.) The touch lock on the door was also a bit confusing to operate - it seemed like you needed to press two random numbers that would pop up to turn the screen on each time, before you could input the code. We ultimately got in, but it wasn't the smoothest process.<br/>* The blinds in the bedroom do not do a great job of blocking light. There is a light from the street that is very visible from the bed through the blinds. (We put pillows up inside the window blinds to block it, which worked reasonably well.)<br/>* There were not a ton of amenities provided. For instance, the listing has no cups (just mugs), no shampoo, and pretty thin towels. To be fair, the listing description is accurate - the listing does not list shampoo or """"""""essentials"""""""" as amenities that are provided. I should have checked more closely when booking. <br/>* The listing does list that it has smoke alarms in the listing description, but, concerningly, I didn't see any present. I did see a number of spots that were clearly designed to hold smoke alarms, but they were all empty. Perhaps they were present but hidden somewhere in the listing. <br/>All in all, we had an adequate experience, but I'm not sure I would book it again if given the chance."

The staff was so friendly and from different parts of the world, the location was right in Chinatown and I was able to walk to it from BART station in 10 minutes. Many restaurants nearby but a lot of them closed by 7 and 8 pm. Bathrooms and shower stalls were always clean, and so were the rooms. There is storage and if you have a lock you are able to use one. I felt safe and comfortable at all times. There are also group activities throughout the week. 10/10 would recommend."

She is very prompt in her response even though we didn’t meet her in person she always checked upon us and made sure our stay is as comfortable as possible. My husband and I stayed there for a week. We went to SFO for a change of scenery because of the pandemic we didn’t get to travel to any place for 2 years.So it’s almost like a work and relaxation for us.My husband worked all the morning and in the afternoons we get to go site seeing so  basically we spent majority of days and nights at Alice’s place the internet is good and she provided a full-size kitchen. Overall she is a good host and I highly recommend her place to anybody who wishes to travel to SFO also there is lots of street parking."

The only thing I would note is the city noise (cars, etc.) is not filtered out at all. However, I fell right asleep and it didn’t bother me during the night.

There is no full refund. You will only get $200 back at most. Honestly, great home but after trying to negotiate with the homeowner to get a refund. I will NEVER stay here again."

The only time there was noise into the late hours was Friday or Saturday evening, but probably wouldn't be an issue with window closed or ear plugs. <br/>Cons:<br/>-If you have a car, parking will be tough. It is mostly 2 hour street parking, so you'd have to move your car throughout the day (was able to find spots along Grant and along Chestnut) OR garage parking. I didn't end up parking in the garage, but looked like it was about $20 for 12 hour parking and I think $27 for 24 hours. At one point, I was lucky enough to find free ALL DAY street parking along Bay St and along North Point St - just watch out for street cleaning signs."

We wish we could give you more than the 5-maximum stars allotted.<br/>Even though your website provides wonderful pictures and descriptions, we could feel the warmth of your flat the second we laid eyes on it. Once inside, we instantly felt right at home. You provided high quality everything we needed for a delightful stay. You even provided things we did not know we needed until we were there!!!  We had all the conveniences of home away from home!<br/>The design of your flat is so SFO! We appreciated that, too, and marveled at the architecture and how deliberately you saved it and yet modernized it for today’s lifestyle.<br/>In addition to the perfect experience inside, we enjoyed the quiet neighborhood outside. Within a few steps, we had access to a delightful bakery, coffee shops and that beach!!  We were an Uber away from the hustle and bustle of the big city!!<br/>You far exceeded all our needs and were extremely responsive to our questions.

Turns out the host had changed the code and not updated the guide. It was late at night and we couldn't reach her through the app or by phone, so we had to ring the doorbell and wake her up. All in all we were standing outside with our luggage for a good half hour. And there was only one key! We had to do an annoying amount of work to plan around only having one key for the two of us. What a pain.<br/>The listing warns of """"""""normal house noises"""""""". Here are some things which are definitely not """"""""normal house noises"""""""":<br/>    - A screaming baby, literally all day one of the days we were there, and part of the day another time.<br/>    - A small child stomping through the house at ~7am for probably half an hour until we texted the host.<br/>Some people might be okay with this level of noise, but you have to put it in the listing! We definitely wouldn't have booked had we known there were infants / small children in the house. Honestly, neither my partner nor I got a single night of good, uninterrupted sleep, and we both sleep _very_ heavy.<br/>The unit also seems to double as overflow storage for the household. There's just piles of stuff everywhere - there's no closet space at all because it's all being used as storage, and the cupboards in the kitchenette are all completely full.<br/>Otherwise, it's a great location - close to BART, close to all the lovely things the Mission has to offer, but it's actually pretty quiet where this house is despite being so close to everything."

Bedrooms were a nice size, plenty of room for everyone. I love the Keurig in the mornings, cleanliness was a plus, the grocery store was a minute walk which was awesome. Parking is a bit tough but we were really lucky to find parking all the time.  I love that the washer and dryer was right next to the space. Yes Garlands parents live upstairs so you will hear noise here and there early in the morning, but we didn’t mind at all. Only thing I tried to make it work was the shower, there’s only one opening side for the shower, and so before you pull down the nozzles make sure your water temperature is what you want bcuz it’s really difficult to rearrange the water temperature without getting wet. I also wanted to add that Garlands mother was so nice, she gave me a tip on how to make rice noodles. Thank you again for a wonderful stay on our first visit to San Francisco."

The check-out time is 12pm which was later than most air bnbs and allowed me to stay and work before leaving.<br/>If you’re arriving after dark it may be challenging to find the house. The beautiful tree lined street doesn’t have any street lights, so I was unable to find the house.

Dave & Carol put the “bnb” back in Airbnb with fresh scones, fresh flowers, great suggestions of where to go, fluffy towels, cozy robes, and super comfy beds. <br/>Add to that a kitchen with everything you could think of (Kitchen Aid mixer, panini press, the list goes on), a hot tub, and your own large yard complete with games, huge hammock, and a veggie garden from which you can pick anything you want (we left the artichoke for the next guest but enjoyed squash and herbs in our dinner).<br/>Dave is attentive and responsive while being respectful and not the least intrusive. Space is beautifully done with quality everywhere and thoughtfully decorated. Our family enjoyed it thoroughly for Thanksgiving week, with hikes and visits to Santa Cruz and the Pacific Grove butterflies, plus plenty of lounging at The Roost. Airbnb doesn’t get better than this. Thanks Dave and Carol!"

Apartment is exactly as described and pictured, it’s small but perfect for two. We were only in the room to sleep so that worked for us. A couple things that could have been better, access to control the heater, listing says it includes heating but to turn it on you have to message the host. I believe host might live in the unit upstairs and the vents are probably connected to the upstairs unit so he controls the heater. Also, you can hear the ppl upstairs, the walls are thin and thus hearing voices and conversations. Since we were not in the unit much, we didn’t care much.

It was also well located, you could walk easily to nice areas (Haight-Ashbury, Cole Valley, Twin Peaks, Castro, etc.), but also because the bus stop is right in front of their house. Breakfast is also included, which is really handy. There were cereals, fresh fruit, eggs and a pancake mix available. <br/>The communication with Jason was also really easy.

Their home is so thoughtfully laid out that it felt like we were stepping into our own home away from our actual home and instantly start living there without needing any time to adjust. Definitely recommend Dave's suggestions for things to do nearby as well as their outdoor Jacuzzi to one and all. We cooked a lot with their herb garden which was a wonderful experience. My 1 year old enjoyed the swing out in the front yard. Lastly, we were really impressed by Dave and family's attention to detail. Some examples include the warmer stone to keep the scones  (which they served for breakfast on our last day and they were delicious!) warm or the cold cider that they had ready for us when we arrived or having official cornhole game rules as part of the guidebook so that the guests could enjoy a fair game when they get the time.

My co-workers and I are professionals in our mid thirties who live in NYC and are well versed in apartment living, and we prioritize being respectful and aware, but the expectation of absolute silence from our apartment was shocking - specifically in the case of receiving a noise complaint for laughing while enjoying dinner at 7:30pm on a Sunday.  <br/>All that to say, the apartment and Tyson were 100% fabulous."

The apartment is situated between Nob Hill and the characteristic Chinatown. The neighborhood is safe and reaching Union Square and Embarcadero from there is very easy and comfortable. Also, the famous cable car stops literally in front of the door, and coming back home down from the street has always given us a beautiful glimpse of sight of the bay. The apartment is as we expected it to be, very welcoming and warm. It really felt like being at home! Neighbors have been very quiet during our stay, we barely saw the others tenants, but for those few times we randomly met them I can say they seemed very nice and polite people. Stefan is a very awesome host, he answered very fast to any question we had and he had always been very polite. I really recommend Stefan's apartment to anyone.

We arrived to a clean apartment well-stocked with everything we might need. My boyfriend and I stayed here while construction was being done our apartment. Since we live five blocks east, the location for us was perfect. Some mornings, I'd wake up early to go to the Presidio to  listen to Pacific Chorus frogs. <br/>We also were happily surprised to find a conduction hot plate, which led to us cooking some hearty meals.  We never ate out once in our week-long stay. The kitchen is well-stocked and has all the basics, at least enough to prepare simple meals for two. To be fair, we also brought a large soup pot from home to batch cook. <br/>I also enjoyed the Netflix, the comfy furnishings, and the ping pong table in the backyard. <br/>The only down sides was the ants in the apartment. The host told us about them the day we arrived, but they were annoying nonetheless. Also, expect some light noise in the evenings and early morning since this is a basement-level studio. I sleep like a rock so it wasn't an issue for me. <br/>On the whole though, this was a great oasis away from our place. Very warm, clean, cozy, and comfortable. Would stay again for sure. Staying here makes our normal SF apartment seem spartan in comparison."

Comfortable, clean, exactly as described, and everything you'd need as a traveler. Communication was easy, the bed was comfy, appliances worked well, and there were lots of thoughtful touches. <br/>One heads up to folks unfamiliar with Portrero Hill is that it is slightly removed from the typical SF attraction neighborhoods so you may have to rely a bit more on driving/Uber/Lyft if you're going further than neighborhoods such as the mission.

"1617","1442027",40154721,"516007658011813946",5,5,"Stayed over a week","I stayed in Rebecca's place for 9 weeks while I was in between apartments and really enjoyed my stay. It is a very decent-sized studio with a good amount of closet and cabinet space, and the high ceilings and large windows makes it feel even more spacious. It also has everything you might need for long stays, including in-unit laundry, garage parking, a nice rooftop garden with lounge chairs and a grill, access to a gym, and the ability to get mail and packages safely delivered. Also I worked from home the whole time and never once had any issues with the wifi. Unfortunately it IS on the super busy (and sometimes noisy) Van Ness street but with the windows fully closed and a white noise machine I always use at night anyway, it wasn't too much of an issue. Plus, the convenience of the location makes up for it! It's only one short block to the underground MUNI that gets you quickly to downtown SF in the one direction and the wonderful Castro neighborhood in the other, a quick 10 minute walk to all the restaurants and shops in Hayes Valley, a short walk to the main SF library, and all of the best performing arts venues and the Asian Art Museum. And, the 49 bus, which stops in front of the building next door (and which will soon be much faster/more convenient once the new bus-only lanes are completed on Van Ness), takes you easily to the Mission neighborhood in the one direction and Polk Gulch and Cow Hollow in the other. Oh, and, it's super convenient to take the above ground F Street car or L Bus to get groceries as there is a stop right at Dolores and Market, where there is a Whole Foods on one side of the street and a Safeway on the other. The stores are also walkable if you don't have too many groceries to carry. So, while there is a parking spot available, you really don't really need a car if you stay here, especially since there are also many Zipcar parking lots within a 5 minute walk for those times you want to go outside of the city.  If you do have a car, the parking situation is a bit convoluted and takes a while to get used to (and can be a bit of a pain if you have a lot of stuff to load in or out of your car), but having parking included in a very safe, secure garage in SF is rare, so it is worth the extra effort. Definitely make sure that your car is within the dimensions that Rebecca states in the listing though! Anyway, I highly recommend her place - I looked at A LOT of Airbnb listings and there are not many that have all of these conveniences for this price!"

The walls are somewhat thin, but it is quiet enough that you can get a good night of sleep. Good value-for-money place to stay if you’re looking for something with fair proximity to the Fisherman’s Wharf area. There are small grocery stores for all your basic needs and good places to eat nearby.<br/>The only thing that’s lacking is a nearby car rental option, though there are plenty in the Wharf/Pier 39 region that can be reached in a short time by car. <br/>If you’re here to visit San Francisco on tour, be sure to ask the front desk to connect you to a tour guide in the city, since they can help book trips to Muir Woods, Napa and Sonoma Valley, as well as the local city through Tower Tours !"

Unfortunately, during my recent stay at Masons home, my family and I experienced countless issues within the home. The first night we were there, the heater didn’t work and it was a very cold 64 degrees inside of the home. After mentioning a second time about the heater’s issues, Mason had his maintenance come to determine what the problem could be. Maintenance states that the Nest wasn’t communicating with the heater that it needed to click on. As a result, maintenance wasn’t able to fix the heater but provided us with extra blankets and two electric heaters (mind you there are five bedrooms). The next morning, the hot water didn’t work. We had to take ice cold showers until again maintenance came to fix it. Maintenance was able to configure the hot water to work again. Thankfully, they dropped off more electric heaters as well. However, the bedrooms are all located (with the exception of one) on one side of the home, if we used the heaters within the bedrooms the power would cut off on that side of the house. So we had to give up on electric heaters and the actual heater working throughout our stay. The dryer and the fireplace also didn’t work. Granted,<br/>maintenance was very kind and explained to us that there are issues with the breakers specifically the ones associated with the heat. Although, Mason tried to remedy the situation by having maintenance come to examine the issue, he repeatedly responded to me with statements like: “this wasn’t happening with the last guests” or “this has never happened before.” I felt he was trying to place the blame on us, and it made me feel uncomfortable. A few other reviewers mentioned that it wasn’t the cleanest, and it isn’t. The amount of flies you will see in the home is insane as well. So much so, that there are two fly swatters located in the kitchen. The floors were dusty, and the bed in the master bedroom had dust and dirt within the comforter and sheets. There are random holes in the walls, and one of the smoke detectors was dangling from the roof. I had such high expectations for this home given the pictures, reviews, and price. I’ve been to multiple AirBnBs but none where I had this many issues. It was truly unfortunate, because it is a beautiful home on the outside."

Lyft is quite expensive in the city, but there's plenty of public transportation. The trolly car and bart is located only a block away which came in clutch.

David provides this with the room in his house, situated above his garage. It has a secure private entrance,  in a quiet and safe neighborhood. Finding close parking on the street was not an issue. The room is clean well furnished.  The bed was comfortable, the spacious bedroom and clean bathroom (with large clean shower) are well-lit. David is a very thoughtful and thorough host. He is as friendly and warm as you need him to be or his hands off as you would like. In other words, he seems to have the Superhosting thing down to a fine art. I would definitely book this room again for a future trip. <br/>Some things to note- The heating provided for this room comes in the form of a small space heater and an electric blanket. Together they are adequate for your needs when sleeping in the room. Considering that Mark Twain once wrote that the coldest winter he ever spent was a summer in San Francisco- adequate Heating is kind of a big deal in the city (especially in December). The room is very clean, with  hardwood floors, and you will feel secure in that room. There just wasn’t any downside to our stay and I highly recommend this super host!"

But in San Francisco just about everywhere else this is a huge problem. I saw motel staff question a few people who tried to wander into the parking area, and send them away. Almost every room has a view of the parking area as well. The walls are a little thin, but during normally quiet hours 11pm-8am it was fine. The heater worked well, and smoke and carbon monoxide detecters were in place. I will definitely book there again. Best LITTLE bar in town across the street """"""""Black Horse London Pub"""""""", really just a small selection of beers and whiteclaw.

It is located close to GG Park and UCSF medical center and seemingly close to coffee shops and restaurants although we didn’t take advantage of them. The kitchenette includes a small refrigerator, microwave, coffee maker (coffee pods supplied) and toaster so you can make a simple breakfast if desired. The bathroom is new, comfortable in size, has a good shower and soap, shampoo and conditioner are supplied. The bed is comfortable and king sized. Kelly is responsive should you have any problems and even left an Apple fritter at our door one morning after a minor issue. My only “complaint” is that there is no independent thermostat for the apt and it can get quite warm being on the top floor. Thankfully you can open the windows and sliding doors onto the back deck to cool it off which we did every night and it worked well to moderate the temperature. In general I do like being on the top floor rather than the lowest level. And the room darkening shades also helped us sleep well. All in all, I highly recommend this rental."

The unit is spacious and comfortable - a large dining room, large and well-equipped kitchen, two good-sized bedrooms, and a spacious living room. Although the decor is plain the apartment itself has lots of period charm -- moldings, textured wallpaper, and original built-in cabinetry. We did not have any problems with noise (unlike some other reviewers) - there is some bus and traffic noise and occasional yelling spilling over from Haight Street - but nothing bothersome or surprising for a city neighborhood. We could hear the upstairs neighbors walking around occasionally, but this is unavoidable for this type of building. The location is great, with lots of restaurants, shops, and other amenities very close by. There is also lots of public transit in the neighborhood, including the Muni station at Carl and Cole with quick service to downtown and the Embarcadero.  We did not have any difficulty finding street parking (two hour limit during the day) but this may have been partly because it was Christmas week when many people leave town.

You stay in a room with a bed, work desk, bookshelf, dresser, closet, and WiFi. There's an adjoining bathroom. The shower gets hot quickly.  I'm about 6'1'', and I fit in the bed without any problems and slept very comfortably. <br/>The room is reachable down a flight a stairs. For anyone who is reasonably healthy, the stairs won't be a problem. But my 85 year old grandmother probably couldn't handle them. A heater quickly gets the room piping hot (maybe some reviewers who said the room is cold didn't notice that the thermostat is outside the room.) I did very light cooking in the kitchen and stored things in the fridge. <br/>As for the area, it's quite charming. There are restaurants, cafes, ATMs, a laundry service, various shops, some bars, and a little public library with an outdoor recreation area -- all reachable within a minute or less of walking.  There's also a grocery store a block away that sells anything you need, including things like pre-made sandwiches and meals. <br/>Access to public transportation is good. There are at least two or three nearby bus lines, and during my 11-day stay I took the bus everywhere, including to the airport. One of the lines drops off/picks ups at a station that takes maybe 30 second to walk to, so I took that bus everywhere - sometimes to connect to other buses and sometimes even late in the night, and I never had any problems. The biggest major nearby street, as far as I know, is Mission St. It's about a 5-10 minute walk, or maybe 1 minute bus ride. <br/>It was a good stay, and I'd stay at Ponge's again."

I felt comfortable running a 3-5 mile loop solo along a popular trail.  <br/>The kitchen is stocked with all that is needed to cook for your guests and the dining room has a lot of natural light and the table comfortable seats 8.  The living room was comfortable and had everything our kidults wanted after a day of sightseeing.  We also appreciated the supply of board games which we utilized frequently.

Dave was also very communicative and thoughtful, even giving a heads up about when traffic gets bad and offering an alternative route to get to The Roost. Dave and Carol are incredibly knowledgeable about the area and are more than happy to answer any questions or give suggestions on what to do or where to go.

The master bedroom is incredibly large and was a great set-up for us and our baby in her pack-and-play, and our big kid loved bunking up with her aunt in a real bunk bed!

I've stayed at a lot of Airbnbs over the years, especially during covid, and most of my experiences have been very positive. But this experience really stands out as being truly excellent. Geralynn was very communicative in advance about check in details, parking, and specific amenities at the house. She also communicated very well during our stay when I had specific questions. The house itself was wonderful. We spent a lot of time in the living room. When I looked at the pictures of the living room on the listing before the visit, the mirrors were a bit perplexing, but the vibe and energy of the house and specifically the living room exceeded my expectations. The mirrors made the space feel bigger, added light, and only enhanced the experience. The kitchen worked well, and there was a generous welcome package for us with wine and snacks. We cooked lots of meals and the kitchen and grill worked well for us. Wifi was reliable and we loved the outdoor shower and large hot tub. The patio itself felt large, private, and close to nature. There were 2 yurts that were super cool. They were warm, unique, and also made us feel closer to nature. The location was also wonderful. We walked about 15 minutes down to the Camp and Conference center to explore the area and played frisbee in a big field there. We also did some hiking nearby which was really fun. Overall, it was a great stay and I would definitely love to visit again!"

There are no curtains for a wall of windows in the living room that look out to a wooded area and the wraparound deck. The images accurately reflect the decor. When I arrived, I had to spray Lysol on the soft surfaces and open all the doors because there was a bit of a musty smell and the place felt a bit worn. There was a welcome basket, but one item expired two months prior and another item was stale and was to expire in several weeks.

The owners, Daniel and Grace, respond to messages promptly and they also have an assistant named Barbara who responds to messages, too. The self check-in process is easy and convenient. But, beware that the unit is bare minimum. The bed is uncomfortable and saggy. The room itself is very small. The only window that opens is in the bathroom. You cannot control the AC, the owner controls it (although you do have a ceiling fan in the room). The WiFi is slow. You are in the middle of two other units and the walls are paper thin. There is no parking spot available for the duration of the stay so you have to park on the street. If you're on a budget, this is a safe bet. If you can afford a higher price, book elsewhere."

It was a perfect location as we were there for a wedding at Roaring Camp and activities at Mount Hermon Adventures.  The house was very well equipped with a great instructions book.  The wifi was very strong. The beds were all very comfortable.  The glamping tents were used and were very fun to sleep in….altho it was pretty cold at night, the heaters and electric blankets kept us comfortable.  There was a nice hot tub on the deck but we were just too busy to use it.  The kitchen had everything you needed, although we only did breakfasts and snacks and leftovers at the house.  The best part was the gaggle of wild turkeys that were very much at home on the property.  They peeked in the windows, came up on the deck to eat birdseed, and just made themselves at home in the yard.  We have wild turkeys in WI but never have we been so close to so many so it was fun to see them. When I had a few questions, Geralynn responded immediately.  We all thoroughly enjoyed our week at Treetop Cabin."

We stayed at the cabin for the weekend to attend a wedding and it was the perfect spot. Close to our venue and other activities like hiking, beautiful views, and everything we needed. Geralynn is an excellent host — very communicative and provided sweet little welcoming touches to the space. The cabin is comfy and had everything we needed for us to cook, grill, hot tub, and spend time together. Everything was clean and comfortable. The cost was excellent split between us all and much more affordable than staying in individual hotel rooms, too. All in all, we loved staying at their cabin and are so grateful to have had such a lovely host."

We partook of every amenity: played darts and cornhole in the yard, rocked on the hammock, dipped in the hot tub under the stars, made s'mores (provided!) over the gas fireplace sitting in our plush robes, cut herbs from the garden for both dinners, made lemonade from Dave and Carol's lemons, played bocce, played horseshoes, swung on the swing, watched birds, communed with the chicken, played with the toys (our son), played the games. Dave brought us hot, fresh blueberry scones on our last morning, and helped us with tips on nearby hikes and attractions. Waffles the dog is a sweetheart.

Billy was the perfect host and kept us really  entertained with his stories and  anecdotes as well as great tips for what to see and where to go. We loved coming home at the end of a busy day. This was my first experience of the original AirBnB concept - that you’re really sharing your host’s home - and for us it made our visit to San Francisco  so much the better for it.

Most people looking at this apartment are probably interested in its proximity to Golden Gate Park and Haight-Ashbury, but I think it's also a real gem for its proximity to Cole Valley, a very cute residential neighborhood a few blocks to the south with several excellent restaurants and coffee shops.<br/>A few of the reviews remark on noise from Haight St. or from neighbors, but we didn't find it bothersome at all during our stay. There is a bit of noise when the upstairs neighbors walk around, but that's to be expected in an older building like this and they keep very reasonable hours.

Ac temperature cannot be regulated by the guest, there was only one vent on the floor and it felt too hot at night.<br/>4. There is a living room right at the main gate separated by curtains and if you are a private person it feels awkward. Sharing room in one apartment is other thing but people living in the living room is at least for me is awkward.<br/>5. Late check out is not OK as it was clearly told by the host that they will charge $20 per hour for late check out so we checked out before the deadline. It is clearly a misrepresentation.<br/>6. Staircase was dirty. <br/>7. Bring your own slippers as the slippers were clearly used multiple times and not cleaned. But again, personal preference.<br/>8.

She always did what she could to find a solution at every problem I faced.<br/>BUT, I have to say that I was very surprised that the kitchen wasn’t equipped at all, you’re  suposed to bring your own stuff such as pans, stoves, cutlery, plates etc … even if the AirBnb description states that the kitchen is fully equiped. Also, there’s a cleaning lady every week but the kitchen was always very dirty 2 days after she came. <br/>There’s a problem with the heater in the rooms so either it’s very hot or very cold.<br/>Finally, I found out that paying for the washer machine and also for the dryer wasn’t okay since we have already paid a lot for the room rental.

Location was perfect... just enough off the beaten path that our night was nice and quiet but still just a quick jump to the Warf, Presidio, art museums, restaurants and even a fun little bar just across the street perfect for a night cap.

The neighborhood is up on a hill. From the living room window, you look west across Mission District, Noe Valley and Twin Peaks. From here, you can watch as sunset fades to a night sky with a twinkling city below. Across the street is a large community garden with flowers, fruits and vegetables; there is a good view here. A few steps away is a neighborhood park with a playground. A few more steps and you will find your own private Lombard street. Turn to the north for the San Francisco city view that never gets old. <br/>I’m convinced this is a perfect place to stay in San Francisco because it’s close to everything, is extremely quiet and leas crowded. <br/>Inside, you have two bedrooms, a kitchen, living room, dining area and bathroom. Like most every house in SF neighborhoods like this one, this house is old with charm, character that is part of the SF experience. The walls display Annekarin’s art in a nice balance of styles. Free art exhibit!<br/>Parking on this street is easy, safe and uncrowded. <br/>I found Annekarin extremely responsive to the questions I had before booking and to a question I had while I was there.

She then waited until I had clearly left on my flight and recanted her prior agreement. <br/>From then on Annekarin was continually combative and insisted that notifying me of this vermin issue was a courtesy and I was not obligated to any more than that. <br/>The result of this was that I had to cancel my stay at the last minute and then end up paying hundreds of dollars additionally in order to commute back to the area I was intending to stay in. <br/>I HEAVILY encourage that all individuals ask Annekarin for proof that the resident is meeting health and safety standards. I also encourage all individuals to stay in contact with Annekarin continually to ensure you are not sprung with a last minute piece of information intended to force you to stay in her Airbnb while it is has a mouse present."

Holly even lent us a soccer ball to take with us! They had several games and crayons and things in the unit which my son also took advantage of. <br/>We were able to walk to several places including delicious restaurants, some slides we found online, the Castro District, and the Painted Ladies. The neighborhood was so charming. We drove up from LA and parking wasn’t an issue for us as we are used to parking signs and moving our car.  <br/>Lastly, we work hard to live a green, plastic- free life and I saw several efforts to do this within the unit which I really appreciated.

We are a family of 5, it was nice to have a tiny extra room for mom and dad to stay in. <br/>We could walk to gharadelli and the waterfront (even our 6 year old could walk it).<br/>St Frank's is a fantastic coffee shop a couple blocks away and we found several restaurants close by that were good too. We felt safe walking around even at night.<br/>There was so much to do we knew we weren't going to be in the room much other than to sleep so saving money on the room to spend on activities was a great choice. We would stay here again."

The place is large enough to accommodate groups of 5-6 comfortably and the location is central to most things you would want to visit in SF without being in a dense neighborhood where parking would be problematic.  Richard was a responsive and generous host, giving us free rein of his place and providing us with a lot of amenities. The artwork in the place is stunning, books galore in a diverse range if you want to read and lots of TV streaming service options.  We truly felt like this was home for us while we were in SF."

The studio is located in a lovely, quiet, residential neighborhood, only a block from Buena Vista Park. The studio occupies the lower level of a stunning home and it has it has a private entrance through the garage. The well appointed and attractive interior space opens up to a lovely, private  landscaped  terrace with a dining table, comfortable seating, fire pit and stunning views of the neighborhood and beyond. We enjoyed having our morning coffee outside, when the weather allowed, and could see dining out there when it was warmer. While you can't really cook a meal in the kitchenette, it was very well outfitted for our basic needs with a Keurig coffee machine (with pods), microwave and small fridge.  The queen size bed was very comfortable and the bedding was very high end. The bathroom was modern and well appointed with plenty of nice towels. The host even provided lush bathrobes for our use. Nice touch!<br/>The owner, is an interior designer and she has put her talented designer's eye to good use in this studio. It was fun to pretend that we actually lived in this beautiful apartment and we would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a place to stay in this part of SF. We shall return!"
"2645","1460628",449279849,"606548294269837551",9,2,"Stayed a few nights","While the location is awesome and the beds were good, everything else left a lot to be desired. Valeria never sent me the check-in information and door code as she says she does when the booking is confirmed. Instead, it took two texts and two phone calls to finally have her call me back with the information an hour after check-in time. It didn't get better after that. In the entry-way, the stairs up to the main unit had junk and random objects on the steps. The floorboards in the kitchen area were a tripping hazard: separating from each other and bowed / sunken. This also made it very difficult to walk around at night quietly because of how loud the uneven flooring was. The pictures of the bnb don't show the reality of the floor because they are outdated. The bathroom, especially the curtain, was very moldy and dirty. There was old, opened food in the cabinets from previous guests. There was also used toothpaste and shampoo that probably came from previous guests as well. Conveniently the pictures of the bnb don't show the pocket bathroom door because it's extremely scratched since it doesn't fit correctly which makes it very difficult to move and impossible to close it completely, meaning it can't lock. The garden is wild and unkept, very exposed to the neighbors' garden area, with the seating area under the steps covered in random objects so it can't be used.  When I went to use the dryer to dry our wet clothes, there was already a load in the dryer which I had to remove, put on the chair, and clear the lint trap, which seems unacceptable to me. By one bed, in-between it and a night stand, there was trash, including a cheese wrapper, on the ground. Frustratingly, you can clearly and loudly hear everything that's going on upstairs, especially when a person up there is up late at night or early in the morning or when presumably a dog jumping off a bed, waking everyone up who's staying below in the bnb. Overall, while this place might seem reasonably priced, for everything that it adds up to be, there's nothing I would recommend about it except its location."

The apartment was in a nice, quiet neighborhood with a little market and cafe. It was easy enough to get a Lyft to the touristy areas when we wanted without being constantly surrounded by noise. When it was warm out, the garden was a wonderful place to sit and read, with occasional appearances from a super sweet little dog. This Airbnb will be great if you’re alone or two very close people, considering the full-sized bed (which was very comfortable) and the fact that the bathroom is right next to the bed. But if you are close, this is a great choice! <br/>Our host Jan was fantastic! She stocked the place with tour pamphlets, cozy blankets, puzzles, a nice TV, a great kitchenette, and more! When we realized we accidentally left the space heater running she was so kind to go downstairs and turn it off, rather than us needing to change our plans and come back. We really appreciated that!"

It is very close to the Golden Gate park attractions (I walked to the De Young muesum) and the BART was one block away. There are aspects that are out of the host's control like other guests, but at least during my stay it was very quiet and I did not see any other guests. I was also able to keep my bags in the communal area because I had a late flight and did not want to lug my bags around the city. I tried not to stay out too late most nights but the nights that I did I felt very safe walking from the BART stop. Also note to other guests the small vent in you room is a heater and there is no need to sleep in a cold room like I did my first night 😅."

The room furniture is awkwardly positioned, the toilet makes a loud noise after flush while the tank refills, and I definitely felt like I was staying in a dive. The following night I stayed in another hotel room in San Jose that was about the same price and it was exactly what I’d expect a hotel room to feel like. This room, I’m wondering where the money is going, bc it’s not going into maintenance and upkeep. Wouldn’t book here again, but my stay was okay."

The bedding and furniture was comfy and there was good space for one of us to work remotely while the other relaxed.  The apartment is very quiet and safe and in an ideal location, just a half a block from Marina Blvd to access all sorts of things. We enjoyed walking along the water for exercise and a view of the Golden Gate Bridge, attending the Fort Mason Food Trucks (Fri night) and Farmer's Market (Sunday), picking up a few things at the nearby Safeway, and being able to choose from many restaurants nearby.

If that was not clear enough: we really enjoyed staying at Dee's (and Sammy doggie's) house as it has everything you could ask for and more: outstanding view over San Francisco, beautiful rooms, of course everything is very clean, the neighborhood is extremely quiet but you are just a few minutes away from the highways.

Parking is free and we were allowed to drop off the car in the morning prior to afternoon check-in time so we could get a jump on sightseeing. This is a very nice plus. <br/>Our room was very basic, this is a place to just to sleep not to relax. The shower head was duct taped, shampoo was missing in our room/not provided. Bathroom was weird, I’m wondering if we got put into an accessible room cuz we checked in extremely late after a full day of exploring SF and who knows maybe we got the last room left over. Pillows small & lumpy. Furniture and fixtures dated and cheapish, electrical outlets rare. In short, if room comfort and amenities is important to you,  this is not the place for you. We weren’t there long just one night and it does the job. <br/>I thought breakfast was advertised but there was none-maybe I read wrong- but i was only expecting basic takeaway cheap pastries so I didn’t sweat it, it’s not like I was missing out much anyway. The front desk people are very nice and courteous and seem to try hard. If you’re looking for a good location and free parking as home base to maximize your time and stretch your dollar while  exploring the city and don’t mind basic accommodations then this is a pretty good value proposition."

The pictures I felt are a tad misleading but since it was just one night, no biggie. I would say if you’re traveling alone it could work but very very limited space for two people. Check in process was easy. It is attached to the main house and the walls are pretty thin. They had an alarm going off around 5am for a while and that was a tad frustrating.

Weekdays may be harder but I didn't stay on weekdays.<br/>Cons:<br/>- The accommodation is very cozy & congested. IMHO it is probably good for 2 people & may be 3. We were 2 adults, 2 small kids and it was quite congested for us. You may not be able to figure out this from the photos unfortunately, since they were mostly close-up shots. Ceiling is also a bit lower that amplifies the congested-ness feeling.<br/>- There is no dining table / dining area.<br/>- Backyard is not that clean and backyard is not (fully) private to this condo.<br/>- The mattress in sofa bed didn't work well for us as the air was leaking. We probably should have reached out to the owner sooner to see if we were operating it correctly. Tip: reach out to owner 1-2 hours before your sleep time on the first day.<br/>Overall, it was an okay stay for us and quite expensive."

Comfortable queen bed, well-stocked kitchenette, colorful little bathroom, & outdoor patio. Bernal Heights is quiet and safe, tucked away from the hustle and bustle of the city. Being just around the corner from Bernal Hill was a treat, and I walked or ran to the top every morning. Best view in the city. If you’re looking for spot in the heart of the city , this may be a little too removed for you. But if you’re looking for a nice quiet neighborhood spot or a place to work or relax for the week (like I was), it’s great! I always felt like I had private space, including the outdoor patio. Size-wise, probably best for an individual or a couple for a few nights to a week. Important to note that you enter the studio via the garage (which you get into via a code) and can come and go as you please. Overall, great stay, and Jeff was a lovely host! Made it a point to say hi and introduce himself and of course we ended up chatting for a while because Airbnb hosts are always the best! Would definitely recommend this spot."

As it was a great and pleasant surprise to me, I don't want to give it all away, but understand that some places are rare and to be cherished and this one is in one of those places--I'm speaking especially of Glen Park, and your hosts to be. Expect Glen Park to be a safe and intimate urban garden oasis so close to the center of San Francisco with a down-to-earthiness and simple places to eat and exhilarating climbs and views on all sides.  It's not a fancy place, but Tyler and Shoreh are genuine AirBnB hosts, the sort of hosts which the founders would have wanted--they live upstairs, they are present, though I did not meet them in person their warmth and care was apparent in their communication, in the snacks they left, the instructions and all the extra amenities you would find in a four-star hotel. To really enjoy this place, it helps if you are reasonably fit, have sturdy comfortable shoes, and have the heart and mind to appreciate how intimate you are in Glen Park with its residents and its natural world just because you get up so close to everything. Enjoy it, trust me, I've travelled many places, and this is not run of the mill. Tip: If you have time, walk up Harry's Steps--there's a vegetable corner store on 30th Street before the climb, and grab a delicious Harmless Harvest coconut water, and you will discover the back way into paradise."

Great shops, cafes, and restaurants. We enjoyed Eats for a big breakfast and Burmese Superstar for dinner. <br/>It’s also super easy to get into town - we did lots of the usual sites with ease! You can top up a Clipper card on Apple Pay and jump on the buses by tapping in with that. A highlight was experiencing a baseball game at Oracle Park stadium. The Giants may not have won, but the atmosphere (and the view!!) was amazing! <br/>On our last morning we headed to The Ferry Building for their big farmers market (big one on Saturdays) - it is well worth a trip! We then headed to Oakland airport to rent a car (much cheaper than renting from San Fran and easy to catch an Uber to!). <br/>Thanks again for a wonderful stay Leticia! We hope we can visit again!"

The location is perfect, the space is large enough to be comfortable, the bed is nice, the couch is great... but then you settle in... and you realize that the entire home is just a giant advertising platform. <br/>It feels like living inside of an unskippable youtube ad feed for an entire stay. There are QR codes to get 10% off the mattress on the bed, there is a basket of snacks in the fridge that are advertisements for certain snacks, there is a bottle of wine that you can have if you scan a code to leave a review, there are some weird skin care products on the counters with ads for how to get them. Everywhere you turn, every object you interact with, there is some glaring form of weird out of place monetization attempt, that never lets you feel like you can just relax. The feeling of having products shoved down your throat at every turn has extended out from the pop-up ads of a bygone era and latched on to the very fabric of reality.  <br/>If you are sick of the constant pressure for more consumption, and the world of hustle culture, then this home is going to be a confirmation to you that everything is actually wrong. A bleak reminder of the glaring fact that Airbnb has actually destroyed the housing market in your city for a few extra bucks, and the inescapable truth that YOU perpetuated it."

With a few cons, the room has a good value-quality ratio.  <br/>Here are a few pros/cons. <br/>Pros :<br/>1. Amazing location<br/>2. The house is very spacious <br/>3. It is also kept fairly clean - the house gets light cleaning 2-3 times a week ( glitches are possible, however)<br/>4. The landlords are fairly responsive <br/>5. Laundry in the house <br/>Cons:<br/>1. Very thin walls in the house, e.g., you can hear if someone puts a fork on the marble table in the kitchen downstairs from the room. Not a deal breaker tho, I stayed here for a month and got used to it eventually. Also, this might very much a typical problem in California ( came here from the East coast where we have brick walls)<br/>2. The bathtub has stayed broken for the whole time I stayed in the room ( I think the shower on the second floor was also broken for some time, but cannot attest how long that had been happening). <br/>3. The laundry room is often in use - it seems that the house keeps bring sheets from other houses here to wash them, which is fine, but then the machines themselves should be cleaned more often."

They even went above and beyond by supplying a coffee pot and toaster at the beginning of my stay! I would recommend them as hosts to anyone!!<br/>The apartment itself has what you need for a long term stay and as mentioned above a great location to explore Hayes Valley and the city as a whole. One thing to note for the lite sleeper, because of its location and age of the building you do hear a little bit of street noise at night so you may want to bring ear plugs, but was completely fine for working in during the day.

They also gave us great suggestions of where we can go in the area and brought us scones on one of the mornings! It was an amazing experience! You won’t regret booking it here!"

It was the perfect getaway for us, and made for a great """"""""staycation"""""""" during a time that could have been stressful had it not been for Katie providing such a great place and making everything so easy for us. The apartment itself is extremely comfortable, had just about everything we needed to go about our normal lives (important for us, since we were going about our normal work weeks during our stay), and the views and all the natural light were stunning. It's a perfect home base that's walkable to our favorite part of SF (the Mission District), but tucked away enough in Potrero Hill that it felt cozy and quiet compared to much of the city.  <br/>Katie made us feel extremely welcome (including our dog!), and gave us a sense of privacy while also seeming to be just a text away at all times in case something was needed. Super comfortable bed and couch, a great TV that swivels so that it's just as easy to watch in bed as it is from the couch, a lovely porch space with a view, and everything we needed to put together a home cooked meal on several occasions. Also appreciated the treats Katie left for us, which included beer, wine, chocolate, and some treats for our dog! Couldn't have asked for a better place to stay, and would definitely re-book if we ever need to be out of our house in the future while staying local."

So helpful (gave amazing recommendations, tips for getting around the city & helped us with parking) and accommodated our schedule to let us drop off our things before check in! Her place is perfectly located in the middle of San Fran, everything you would need is no further than a mile & a half away. There wasn’t really a kitchen but that was no problem since the food scene in San fransisco was incredible and there was no need to eat at home :-).

We were in town for a family event and took Uber many times (also a first) and the longest we had to wait for transportation to arrive was four minutes. This told us we were in a well-serviced neighborhood with very easy transportation connections.  We didn't try any of the restaurants nearby because all of our meals were served at the family events we attended so I can't speak to those.  I would give Roz and Adam a clink with champagne glasses and say """"""""well done!  Thanks for the memories."

The outside of the building does look somewhat dated but that is about all the """"""""bad"""""""" with this listing. At no time despite looking dated did we feel unsafe walking outside in the neighborhood. We were met by our host when we arrived (check in is at 2pm which is great). The host gave  us a very thorough tour of the property and the home, showing us all the features along with helping us figure our way around the city. The unit pictures do not do it justice. I do need to point out that this is not a kid friendly unit, which for our trip was something my wife and I were looking for. <br/>Both whole foods and trader Joes are a couple of blocks away which made food shopping easy. Union square was also about 10 minutes walk which meant we did not have to have any rented cars, and got by either by public transit, uber/lyft or just plain old walking. <br/>All in all I have to say that this ranks among my top 3 airbnb units that I have had the good fortune of having rented. I highly recommend this unit if you are traveling to SF and looking for a non kid friendly central location"

It is pretty far away from most of what SF has to offer, though, so expect to spend a ton of money on Ubers. The house is well-appointed but 2 bathrooms for 11 guests is too few and very inconvenient, especially since one of the bathrooms is attached to a bedroom so the other three bedrooms have to share a single bath. And it was a small bathroom at that. Our check-in experience was very disappointing, as the house was not ready until 7 pm the day we arrived. The host did not apologize for the situation and instead told us to enjoy the surrounding area. I would have expected him to waive the cleaning fee, but he only offered us a 2 hour late check out. The back patio is very cute but was quite dirty. I am an AirBnB host myself and find it extremely annoying when hosts have a long list of check-out instructions that include cleaning. As guests you pay high cleaning fees - that’s what they are for! Not appreciated. I would not stay in this AirBnB a second time."

The location was amazing - steps away from the coastal path and only a few kilometres away from incredible viewpoints at lands ending making for some memorable morning runs. Very easy to get into central SF with the tram 2 blocks away - it is the best line too running direct to Embarcadero in about 40 minutes. Cheap, safe and easy to ride the tram. There are also more local spots including Judah&9 and Irving&15 worth exploring. Although Golden Gate Park is only a few blocks away and easy walking distance, beware that most of the activities (science academy, De Yeung etc) are towards the far end of the park which is a very long walk, or a few stops on the tram to get to. The apartment itself was clean and comfortable with everything we needed for a 3 week stay. We have a 4 year old and felt the neighborhood was very safe. There is loads of free parking around. We would certainly stay here again if heading to San Francisco. Thanks Heather!!"

The Mission has endless restaurant options at every price point. Omar's home is across the street from a community park, and the view of the park from the front sitting room is lovely, especially in the evening during sunset. San Francisco landmarks and tourism are easily accessible by highway or the BART. If you use the garage during your stay, avoid renting an SUV or larger vehicle. We rented a Ford Explorer because a member of our family often uses a mobility scooter that we needed to transport. We were grateful for garage access for storing and charging the scooter, but we didn't trust ourselves to get the Explorer into the garage without scraping the car. Street parking can be annoying, but it's not unmanageable. The patio and garden in the back are perfect for peaceful, private afternoon tea. The kitchen is well appointed with dishes of every size, glasses for every drink, pots, pans, and more. We appreciated the freedom to cook at the flat and to enjoy a quiet meal in the beautiful dining room. If you're a cat person, Zoe makes the stay all the sweeter. Maybe the best AirBnB ever!"

Alison's place was so roomy & it was perfect with 2 large bedrooms, 2 bathrooms & plenty of storage space. We loved that each room had it's own coffee maker with coffee, sugar, & creamer along with a fridge & microwave which made having breakfast there so convenient. She also provided plates, napkins, and cutlery. We were gone most of the day sightseeing but it was lovely to come home to the spectacular view from the deck overlooking the GG bridge! I could get used to that!  Plus, it was the perfect place to enjoy our coffee in the morning. It was warm the week we were there but there were fans & windows that opened which made the air flow to keep it cool upstairs. Our adult son who lives in Oakland was able to park his car on the street each day when he came to pick us up so that was helpful that he didn't have to look far for parking. It was also walking distance to the marina which has many restaurants and walking paths around the waterfront. The only thing I would wish for is that there were more washcloths and towels & something to wash the coffee cups with (there were paper towels, too) but I really can't complain since we had a fantastic trip.

The only thing to be wary of is the noise in the area. Firstly, it's in the city, so as always, expect sirens and auto and motorcycle noise to be somewhat frequent. If it were just that, though, I wouldn't have had any issue. However, this place is directly across from a dog park which means constant barking during the day, and the neighbors in the building seem to have zero regard for others. I'm not sure if the people there were other AirBNB guests or what, but I had constant issues with people stomping, slamming doors, running machines literally all day (someone legit had I think a washing machine going for 24 hours straight that was infuriating to try sleeping through), and the generic street noise. Suffice it to say, probably not a good fit for light sleepers, but you could make do, especially if you're planning to be out exploring rather than in the unit during the day. The other thing to note is that a parking citation is ludicrously expensive, so pay close attention to signage, and dates and times. The meter maids are relentless!"

My 18 year old son used the sofa sleeper and declared it very comfortable too. There is a large closet with plenty of room for hanging clothes, plus an iron and ironing board. The little kitchenette includes two burners, a half fridge, sink, and a coffee pot and filter for pour overs. The bathroom is clean and modern with excellent water pressure in the shower.  Gary is a terrific host and went out of his way to be accommodating.  He let me know the unit was ready early so that I could check in soon after landing at the airport. When I had trouble with the pin code (due to my own mistake) he came right down to help me get in.  Finally, the location is perfect. It’s a short walk to 24th Street which is Noe’s Main Street with with lots of stores and restaurants and easy access to public transport.  We loved our week long stay and wouldn’t hesitate to go back to Gary’s place when we find ourselves in San Francisco next time."

We were absolutely floored!<br/>The home is spacious, charming, and immaculate. We had everything we needed and more - linens, toiletries, dishes, water bottles, washer/dryer with supplies, etc. It was all made available to us without having to ask and everything was clean/fresh. Rico and Pat also provided us with private access to their peaceful and beautifully designed garden. Highly recommend grabbing a morning bun from Tartine and enjoying it in the garden!<br/>On top of the actual accommodations, the proximity to Bernal Heights Summit and its picturesque views cannot be beat. The area felt very safe and we never had an issue finding nearby on-street parking.<br/>And Rico! He was very responsive and so kind. He provided his personal cell and checked on us via message a couple times during our stay to ensure we had everything we needed.

It’s immaculately clean, artful and exceptionally set up. Easy to get downtown and only minutes away from the funky Mission District, but also peaceful and quiet so it’s the best of both worlds. Walking distance to Muni and Bart, cool bars, and a park with stunning views. The bedding is incredibly comfortable and the room is a real treat — spacious yet cosy, with sweeping views of Twin Peaks and Sutro tower over rolling hills. Matthew is so friendly and personable, and also respectful of allowing as much privacy as needed. He went the extra mile to ensure my stay was comfortable and enjoyable and I really enjoyed his company, which overall tops off this place as a real gem of a stay. I’ll definitely be back! Thanks so much Matthew"

There is one off street parking spot, which is really nice, as the neighborhood is otherwise tough for parking.  Ellen was a great host, very communicative, and her place is her actual lived in residence—not a full time Airbnb ‘hotel’— and so it has complete facilities which she graciously shared.  Her kitchen was fully equipped and we ate all our meals in, cooking ourselves.  It is still an urban environment, and there was a little street noise on Friday night, but we were early to bed and early to rise for our event and in general the neighborhood was very quiet.

Elles ne sont pas entièrement satisfaisantes, certains points sont vraiment négatifs pour nous.<br/>Mais nous allons commencer par les choses que nous avons apprécié. Le quartier est génial, il peut faire très pauvre au premier abord mais a y regarder de plus près on se sens vraiment dans la vie d'un habitant de San Fransico,<br/>vous avez des restaurants typiques, des boulangeries mexicaines, des donuts, des boutiques, etc... vraiment partout, c'est très vivant.<br/>Quand vous êtes européens on est pas habituée à quotoyer ce type de pauvreté, si ca vous dérange évitez Mission.<br/>Vous etes près des transports vers le centre ou les lieux touristiques. Bous pouvez aller sur la bute juste a coté, le park Dolores en 20 mn a pied. enfin le quartier et l'emplacement, vraiment bien.<br/>La disposition de l'appartement est bien, c'est chouette d'avoir une chambre, c'est petit mais trés pratique.<br/>Pour ce qui est des choses que nous n'avons pas aimé il y a d'abord les chiens, alors en soit les chiens ne sont pas un problème, on les a croisé quelques fois ils sont très gentils (ma fille adore les chiens en plus)<br/>mais ils font leurs besoin (pipi) dans le petit passage qui passe sous la maison, un couloir que vous devez emprunter pour rejoindre votre appartement derrière. Et ca c'est vraiment très désagréable, ca sens très mauvais (à savoir que ca ne sens pas quand vous êtes dans l'appartement).<br/>Un autre souci c'est le ménage. Notre première soirée on a hésité à quitter l'appartement à cause de ces deux problèmes. Mais trop compliqué de trouver un logement dernière minute. Quand je vois les frais qu'il faut payer sur AirBnB pour le ménage je ne comprend pas.<br/>il y avait de la poussiere partout, la vaisselle n'était pas toujours propre, les WC, fauteuils avec poils d'animaux  et même le micro onde... enfin on a passé notre première soirée a faire du ménage. <br/>Deux autres soucis moins embêtant si il n'y avait que ceux la, le lit, les canapés et fauteuils ont bien fait leur vie (il sont vieux et abimés), il est pas trés agréable de passer du temps dessus.<br/>Et enfin la terrase, sur les photos de l'annonce elle semble bien entretenue mais aujourd'hui elle semble à l'abandon, elle mériterai un grand coup de netoyage et de tri des objets qui l'emcombre.<br/>Pour résumer mon conseil, c'est si vous venez a San Fransico rapidement pour passer des journées bien remplies à a visiter, cet appartement peut vous convenir,<br/>mais si vous venez profiter, vous sentir cher vous dans un cadre agréable, passer des journées à l'interieur parfois, je ne recommanderais pas cet apparement.<br/>Apres pour ce qui est de notre hote, elle a toujours été très gentille et arrangeante, elle  répondais très vite à nos messages."

I was reluctant to book a shared room since I haven’t done that in years, but due to a last minute booking combined with a big conference in town driving up the hotel costs, I booked Mark’s place. I’m so happy I did because I enjoyed this much more than an exclusive hotel. Mark was an incredibly kind and generous host. He had fruit and healthy muffins available to grab. He was excellent at communicating expectations (such as “I’m having friends over for dinner, they’ll be here when you get back and you are welcome to join us if you like”) and accommodating of whatever social level I was comfortable with at a given moment. Once I was in the “suite” I felt complete privacy. The suite is positioned in the apartment on one end, so you aren’t sharing a lot of wall space with anyone else. Everything was clean and had the right amount of attention to detail. The location was much more interesting than what normal hotels in SF have to offer within walking distance - I had two excellent dinners within a few blocks of Mark’s place and was able to squeeze in an early morning walk to Dolores park and back before work.

Lots of restaurants very close by. We flew in and didnt have a car, but there seemed to be lots of parking available. We stayed 2 nights before our cruise, and had a late flight home after... i asked if we could store our luggage for the day after our cruise ended so we could site see a little before heading to the airport.

Unfortunately for me, I did not enjoy staying here as the noise was untenable. I was prepared for old house noises but the room looks out over Oak St which is a major thoroughfare with relentless traffic 24/7 plus there was a bit of construction across the street while I was there. You are also at the mercy of other guests if you are a light sleeper since you can pretty much hear a pin drop from upstairs. It was also quite hot during my stay and I requested a fan to be brought in to drown out the noise and help with heat which ended up being a whole fiasco in and of itself. Other things: the room gets the morning sun and the curtains are sheer so bring an eye mask. The bed is soft and the bedding meagre. The shared bathroom was a bit gross but clean. All things that are forgivable when staying in a budget accommodations but with the amount of fees and service charges tacked onto my stay, this really wasn't affordable at all.  Pros: great area, nice old house, the room is spacious, very clean and it is great that it has a sink and table to sit at to eat. (could use some hand soap though). Super easy, seamless check-in and Josh is quick and responsive via email. Right across from the park and a few grocery stores nearby plus lots of amenities."

I arrived early and was able to store my luggage in the entryway (was a little nervous at first, but everything was totally fine/safe! There is not much room in the entryway tho if you have a lot of luggage...). I was also able to check in early which worked out very nicely! The location was really great with lots of shops, restaurants,  the park, and bus lines nearby. The one downside was that noise may be an issue for some. You can hear what's going on in the hallways, next door, doors opening/closing, etc. I think it was mostly singles on the floor so didn't overhear many conversations, but still ended up watching a movie with headphones on to keep noise down. The floors were quite creaky so I was also a little worried about the room below too. Also I hit my head on the slanted ceiling in the bathroom but that's my own fault haha.

Also, since the house is lived in most of the year as opposed to being a vacation rental or dedicated Airbnb, all the appliances are fully functional and the kitchen/bedrooms/bathrooms are more than fully equipped :)<br/>Tim was an amazing host! He made us feel welcome and was fast to respond to any questions we had. His hospitality and warmth and mutual trust made it truly feel like we were staying at a super attentive and thoughtful friend or family member's place."

I can drive or take the bus and other public transport from her place if I want to go to the city centre. There are free street parking around though sometimes needs a bit of searching around. <br/>What I like Grace’s place most is that there is a big garden where Grace has planted lots of flowers and fruit trees so you can really sit and relax in it. The room is also comfortable. <br/>Grace is also very informative yet respects your privacy. What you need to do is just ask, and help will arrive in no time.  <br/>Nice stay. Highly recommend."

Our boys loved staying in the study room filled with books and old school toys. The kitchen was well appointed and definitely ready for a gourmet meal, but you won’t need to cook because there are so many incredible restaurants nearby. We really enjoyed sitting in the full sized dining room overlooking the city, a truly rare find here. Dolores Park is just around the block with arguably the best kids playground in town. And having an on site washer and dryer made unpacking back home a breeze. At the end of the day the J Train, or as my kids liked to call it, The Nap Train, is waiting for you to take you back home.

Some folks might feel that it's a little too far out of town but honestly the buses are reliable and cheap. <br/>Harris himself was a great host and communicated exactly what was expected of us as guests. Room was clean and well stocked. We could also use the kitchen if needed. Only complaint I'd have - and this is of no fault of the host - is that there was just 1 bathroom to use amongst all guests.

There is also a musty / damp smell throughout the property. We stayed at the property for 20 mins and notified airbnb we were unhappy.

Normally, I have mark the animals filter on, due to we have a cat. I don’t know it was because the app was upload or I it wasn’t mark that day. Anyways, I realized about it and texted them right away ( they wouldn’t lose more than 1 hour , with the house reserved). Then, the hostes sent  me the policy of cancelation link, where i could mark the option where I was asking for an exeption and they could agree or not to give me my money back. After I explained that it was a mistake, I was travelling with my parents, who are on their 70’s and we could NOT afford another aibnb ( i booked it for 5 days) if they didnt give us the money back, they decided to decline the request, and tell me if i bring my cat with us anyways (which i would never do) they would kick us out.  So, honestly, it was really really disapointing. I didnt have any other option than look for a person who would take care of my cat for those 5 days ( that was 200 plus dollars).<br/>I honestly, felt really really disapointed, and didn’t have any other options than going there. <br/>The house was inmaculate clean, a nice bathroom, as well. The neighbourhood is quiet and well comunicated. <br/>The second bed wich is a couch,  it’s old. First night I slept in it and was a nightmare, had to end laying the matress on the floor the next four days. <br/>I’ve been travelling quite a lot, and using Airbnb as well. I can say it’s the first time I had to deal with this kind of situation, and find people that rather keep 1000 bucks than help you out. Never coming back for sure."

It was about a 15 minute walk to the campus, and about 25 or 30 to the specific university building within the campus I was going to. A lot of the walk is around Lake Merced which made for really lovely views, actually, and the few times I walked home past sunset I didn't feel unsafe. It's quite close to a supermarket as well, which was handy. It was clean and had everything I needed for my four-night stay. The hosts were quick to respond and flexible with check-in which I really appreciated. The only small downside I found was that the walls were quite thin, so I would recommend bringing earplugs if you are a light sleeper - I didn't hear anything the first night but I think it was another guest a couple days in who talked quite loudly on the phone. However it's a great choice for an affordable option in San Francisco, seems well connected with public transport, and is really ideal if you want something close to San Francisco State University."

I asked for extra towels two times, and they were so nice and kind ! I needed a bottle opener for a wine bottle and they had it !! I stayed for 5 days / 4 nights in the three beds family of 5. It was great! Something that really stood out was the microwave, I didn’t use it but I know it’s hard to find that !! Hopefully they find someone to take better photos of the room because it exceeded my expectations, the photos don’t show how nice room #29 is ! Also the buses are close , take one bus to China town or go in the opposite direction and end up at fisherman’s wharf. Also FREE PARKING !!! And a lot of parking too ! I felt like my car was super safe which is a relief. Two blocks down was an amazing pizza place (Chico’s pizza - if that’s what it is) also a great ramen place next to the pizza place! There’s a mini market on the corner of the street good to get snacks. I would just advise that the area is 5/10 , my family and I didn’t feel safe being out after 8:30, it’s just not the safest. OH Mezcalito Bar a block away was so good!

I've never seen a place so beautifully restored, or so full of unusual things, especially the array of kitchen implements! I also want to put in a good word about the real breakfasts Christina provided. Many Airbnbs don't provide any breakfast at all, but each morning we found English muffins to toast, with jam and butter, as well as hard-boiled eggs, cereal, yogurt, juice, and fresh fruit. Transportation is good, too, if you can climb short but steep hills. It's a short walk from the J tram, twenty minutes to the Ferry Building, or the 48 bus, the same to Ocean Beach. And when we left, we walked down to BART at 24th & Mission to get back to SFO. We had a car at the beginning of our stay, for the weekend (no non-resident weekday parking longer than 2 hours anywhere in the city), and were able to park right outside. And we're in our 70s.<br/>I should mention a couple of possible drawbacks that are inherent in a meticulously restored classic house. Our bed, while comfortable, was so high that it wasn't easy for us to climb up into. The staircase's double turn -- I've never seen one like it before -- requires extra care going up or down to and from our bathroom (the other room gets a bathroom on the same floor). And while the shower is a good vigorous rain shower, the wraparound curtain makes it awkward to soap all over, and there's no grab bar. Consider these issues before taking this room, but if you accept them as part of the price you pay for a memorable experience, this is a great value."

The entrance was a little scary upon arriving late at night. There were no windows with direct sunlight. The Courtyard needed a privacy screen.

There was so much personality in the decor and none of the usual soulless cookie cutter and corporate air bnb crap. I appreciate that Vera and Cléber take so much care and put some heart and soul into their space. Other air bnb hosts please take notes from these two!

Just like the exercise you get walking the hills of this city, their hospitality is matchless. Coziness abounded from the soft scent of clean laundry to the supportive yet cloud-like memory foam mattress and the warm sun blanketing the solarium from the eastern sky as it rose over the city skyline of San Francisco Bay.  This was the fourth AirBnB on our Pacific Coast Highway road trip and after 1.5 weeks on the road we had the best sleep in one of the largest cities in the US.  They were extremely welcoming of our 2 year old Labrador Retriever who got along fine with their dog and only barked when he thought strangers were approaching.  They even shared a dog toy with him.  Overall, the stay was a blessing! Together, with their dog Jasper, they are a tremendous trio!"

The 2 bedrooms are comfortable, each with their own decorative theme and bath robes that really came in handy one chilly evening. <br/>As described by the host, Stephen, the house is located in a quaint neighborhood that is walking distance to the BART subway station and even closer to the Glen Canyon Park. If you have kids, they will love the park. Our 14 year old loved climbing the rocks in the upper part of the park. When you come to San Francisco don't forget to bring great walking shoes, layers (the temp really can change ~20 degrees in a day), and be prepared to walk up some incredibly steep hills.

We ate one of the best meals of our trip at Woodhouse fish Co. 1 block away. We used public transportation and download the Clipper app to our phones for ease of adding funds and scanning on the buses/trolley/cable car and trains. Cynthia and Steve have a beautiful home!

After my flight time changed, I messaged the host and was able to check in hours early, and arrived to find a welcome note and a fridge freshly stocked with essentials (including bread, milk, eggs, cheese, and wine). The location was a huge plus -- a doable walk down into the lively Mission District but perched up in a calm and very-safe feeling residential neighborhood. In the past, other places with """"""""fully stocked kitchens"""""""" have offered a sad reality (like, two forks and a small frying pan, with a paring knife if you're lucky) but this was the opposite. I'm pretty sure you'd have everything you'd need to cook a gourmet meal and host a dinner party of 8. In short, it had all the amenities, conveniences, and personal touches of an actual home that someone could live in full-time as opposed to the characterless, understocked, party-centered crash pads that have dominated the rental market in the last few years. Oh, and you'll never get tired of view out back across the city from the kitchen and balcony--truly stunning at every time of the day/night."

Some considerations of the house and area:<br/>-We we’re a family of 4 with teens kids. The kids loved having their own rooms for the stay. One bathroom wasn’t a big problem, even though we’re usually spoiled with 4.<br/>-great water pressure and heated water (immediately!) in the shower. <br/>-House has so much you may need (hair dryer, many towels, extra TP, kitchen utensils, scissors, qtips, lotion, laundry detergent that looks like so many people have bought and left half used, plenty of pillows and blankets, floor fans, etc.)<br/>-there are TV’s in the living room and one bedroom. It was great to unwind in the living room with the window open for a nice breeze. We also enjoyed the trivia game cards!<br/>-Kitchen has everything you’d need to prepare a meal (though you won’t want to with all the great restaurants in walking distance!). It took us a bit to get used to the small receptacles for trash, recycle, compost and we had way more trash/recycle than could fit. So we tried to use paper bags to keep separate.<br/>- Location is incredible for restaurants and pub crawling. We stayed for a week and didn’t make a dent in all the options!<br/>- it got unseasonably hot when we were in town (over 90 in June!). The house doesn’t have central air, so we did our best cycling air in through the front door, window and using the floor fans.<br/>-the home is at the back of an alley. Great for privacy, but also pretty common for homeless to hang out near the main road. There were fresh feces dropped not far from the door early in our stay, so that was unpleasant. Unfortunately a lot of homeless in the general area. <br/>- don’t recommend a car unless you have to. $35+ per 24 hours, you walk through a gambit of homeless to get to the garage and they say they lock overnight, but they don’t. Lost a back windshield (with nothing left in the car) our 2nd night. It is electronic payment which was easy and convenient.<br/>-probably not a great location for small kids, but was fine for teens. Ours went out alone and could walk a few blocks for snacks or meals no problem.<br/>Overall enjoyed our stay and having the place to come back to each day was a real treat!"

I messaged the hosts to tell them they should check for bed bugs but they basically shrugged me off and said they’d never had a problem with bed bugs but they’d have the housekeeper check. If you stay here don’t stay in room 2C because I don’t think they actually ever checked for bed bugs and you will probably be bit. There were also a few cockroaches. The front door was open most of the time and was hard to figure out how to lock. It was very noisy outside and parking was very hard to find if the front parking spaces were taken so just be weary of that.

Also a few nice places to go out to eat or drink at in close walking distance. The perfect San Francisco urban stay. 😊"

We had a zoom-call with Tim before coming, where he walked us through all the details, and he and his children were ready to tackle any problems (there were none).<br/>The property is very private at the end of a winding road. The pictures are real and showcase a great and expansive house (though no grand piano as in the pics). Sometimes felt like you'd rented something that should be a hotel for dozens of people!<br/> It might be worth knowing that three other people live on the lot: one in a small, separate building, plus a couple over the garage (extending in over the downstairs kitchen with a bit of floor creaking). They were nice and accommodating (and got us fresh eggs from the chickens) and also helped us find the best supermarkets etc (answer: Lucky), but just know you won't be all on your own. <br/>Overall, a great place to stay — we loved it!"

Sam and her husband were friendly and helpful hosts who also respected my privacy. In addition to the quality of the apartment itself, the major appeal is LOCATION! Upper Noe Valley is a wonderful neighborhood: clean, peaceful, and very safe. As I noted, a bus goes right by the house and other public transportation options are very short walks away, including the J Church train line. So it is very easy to get around in San Francisco, and the wider Bay Area, from this base. Within the neighborhood, there is an old-style butcher shop where I got some excellent meat and a wonderful fruit and vegetable store. There are also several very good restaurants. I especially recommend Alice's, a Chinese place on Sanchez and 29th, less than five minutes walk from the apartment. And Mitchell's ice cream is also nearby!

Stefan was a pleasure to deal with and communicated well. (One note that others have mentioned - the house has internet, but it is a hotspot so it may not always be conducive to zoom-type needs if you need to mix a little work with vacation.

The house sits on a calm, shady block in the midst of a bustling urban neighborhood--and is full of many good books!  We had a luxurious amount of space, comfortable beds, and a good shower.  All of us enjoyed the hot tub out back and one of the kids made regular use of the bathtub in the evenings.  We made daily and heavy use of the kitchen as well, finding all that we needed to make meals, and enjoyed sitting at the large dining room table.  The front bedroom has some street noise, but we live in a similar setting in another city, so were okay with it.  One person in our group has mobility issues, and had to take the front and back steps very slowly and with much caution.  The shower has a grab bar that was appreciated.  The backyard is a quiet oasis--very enjoyable.  We didn't have a car, and got around via public transit and Lyft.  The BART station is a 10-15 min walk.  We got our groceries from various places in the neighborhood, particularly Valencia Whole Foods and the Bargain Outlet Grocery.  We got some quick-grab items and produce at the many local bodegas, using some Spanish in the process.  FYI: Dolores Park, about a 20 min walk from the house, offers some great views of the city and has many cafes/shops close by.  We particularly enjoyed Tartine Bakery near the park.  Shea (the house  owner) was gracious and helpful throughout our stay, and a strong communicator.  We would definitely stay here again."

Very clean, and quite comfortable. Groceries and pharmacy are very close, as well as lots of options to eat.<br/>I am not tech savvy at all, and Jack was able to explain how to access live tv and other features. My only problem was that the wifi was spotty, sometimes cutting out, freezing the tv and/or my computer for a time. <br/>But Jack's AirBnB really felt like a respite while I was in San Francisco for work over two months.

Access to shared living room and kitchen that are pictured aren't available if that is a factor in you choosing this place. I personally didn't intend on using either. The unit is downstairs with the room and bathroom, and host stays upstairs. While everything mentioned was included, I had some experiences with appliances and dusty surfaces that weren't cleaned prior to our visit ie spider webs, dirty microwave, minifridge, toaster. I think if you plan on driving, great location, but for public transportation - not so much. While there are some buses nearby, commutes to most attractions will take over an hour and involve transferring. It was also rather chilly during my stay, and the space heater provided wasn't doing much for me. I don't mean to be negative, just think transparency may be helpful. Other than some areas that could use some improvements, it was a comfortable stay."

Jinsoo’s space was so cozy and had every amenity that we could ask for during our four-day stay. We were able to make a nice pot of coffee every morning and evening before going out on the town. The beds, linens, and pillows were all very comfortable. The split bathroom (toilet separate from shower) worked great for our four-person group. The keypad was convenient for easy in and out access.

I appreciated the parking space and private entry. although there's a shared wall it's still very private and nice. the bed and comforter were very comfortable! Jie was very thoughtful to leave us some snacks. The backyard made it feel spacious. I also enjoyed having a desk to work. The bathroom shower was a bit tight my boyfriend is 6'1 and had to crouch down and be mindful of elbows in the bathroom but it wasn't that big of a deal. just in case that's something you're needing to be mindful of. there was plenty of hot water and even some toiletries. there isn't a TV if that's your thing but there's so much to do in the area and that's why I loved how convenient this home was for getting around. Jie was so communicative, thoughtful, and detailed which made checking in/out a breeze. I would recommend giving this spot a try! I would have been very comfortable even during a longer timeframe. thanks again Jie!"

Tons of lovely dishware and cookware, great for a family stay with kids (we were with our 5-yr old). In addition to the eclectic 20's ambiance, all the furnishings and beds were extremely comfortable, so much so that we ended up spending much more time hanging out there than we expected to!

You see lots of drug addicts and homeless people hanging around on the streets. In the alley where the studio is located, cars were broken into every other day. The area should be avoided as a tourist - I felt very uncomfortable. However, it has to be noted that the studio is located in a yard which is locked very safely.<br/>Studio: The kitchen was poorly equipped . Only one (blunt) knife and one cooking spoon are a bit too little if you really plan to cook. There were in general very little dishes which I found disappointing.<br/>Nevertheless, we were satisfied with our stay and felt well looked after by the hosts."

Immediately in the neighborhood there is great options for food and drinks not to mention easily accessible to both the Presidio and Golden Gate Park. If you are looking to explore other parts of the city, the location is on & close to main roads which make it easy for public transportation or Uber/lyft. <br/>The apartment was super clean and had everything you could need. The photos accurately represent where you will be staying. The one thing I would mention is there is not a table to sit and eat at, but that really isn't a problem as there is so many great options in the area. Easily can enjoy coffee in the backyard if you want or there is seating in the living room or bedroom you can use. <br/>I travel to the city often and absolutely will be booking with Toni again."

Jeff was an amazing host - sincerely welcoming and very responsive. We enjoyed the benefits of the room being located through the garage, such as a private entrance, access to the washer/dryer, and privacy. The only slight issues we ran into was the ventilation in the bathroom when you shower, which Jeff gives you a heads up about and is pretty readily resolved by opening a window, and the lack of shelving in the shower to hold toiletries. However, those were very small minor inconveniences that in no way meaningfully detracted from our stay. We sincerely enjoyed our time at Jeff’s and would recommend it to anyone!"

The price, the pictures, and the other reviews all confirmed that I needed to book it. Upon arrival I realized everything I had read was spot on. Could not have been happier with the home. Alice is a wonderful host and immediately available. I highly recommend choosing Alice’s spot. You’ll love it!!!!"

Il monolocale è bellissimo e pulitissimo, al piano terra dotato di frigorifero, fornetto elettrico, forno a microonde e macchina del caffè con già i filtri. Bagno con ottima doccia e un disimpegno molto comodo. Nonostante l’appartamento sia un po’ lontano dal centro (union square, chinatown, ecc) (50 min in autobus) la fermata dell’autobus (linea 7) è a 2 min a piedi e comunque dista circa mezz’ora dai musei del Golden Gate Park. A San Francisco l’auto è inutile quindi meglio utilizzare gli autobus che sono comodissimi per raggiungere qualunque destinazione di San Francisco si voglia. Il letto è molto comodo, abbiamo dormito sempre benissimo; c’è anche un tavolo dove abbiamo fatto colazione e cenato. Vicinissimi ci sono anche un fornitissimo supermercato stile Whole Foods dove si può fare un’ottima colazione inoltre sempre nelle vicinanze ci sono un ristorante di hamburger buoni, pub, buon panificio e tavola calda messicana e cinese. È un quartiere praticamente sull’oceano (si sente molto l’aria di mare) residenziale e super tranquillo. Personalmente mi sento di raccomandare al 100% questo monolocale per una coppia per stare a San Francisco anche per più giorni. Davvero molto bello e confortevole!"

It does have two units so there may be someone staying in a separate neighboring unit.  We really enjoyed our time in the house and would have rated it 5 stars, but there are a couple elements which can be improved such as adding a TV in the main living area and adding more kitchenware.  However, if you don't intend to cook much or watch TV, this home is great.  The only other item I would note is the wifi upstairs is very weak or non-existent. But, these are all things which can easily be fixed.   Katia is a great host and very responsive."

Lots to see/do in walking distance. <br/>There were perhaps some things that didn’t quite work as well for us. We’ve never had to highlight issues before but at the same time, for the price, there are some things that are worth considering. It is an old house so certain quirks are to be expected however the overall maintenance of the property is a little run down and could be improved. And it was also our first stay in San Francisco so we didn't have much to compare with.<br/>The house provides all the amenities that one would need however it is quite full of stuff, particularly in the kitchen and bathroom areas which didn’t leave a huge amount of free space for our things. The fridge was playing up a bit and freezing things so we turned the temperature up which didn’t really resolve the issue. The washing machine was quite grubby, looked like it had never been cleaned. Overall whilst the house was lovely and linen and towels clean, it was quite dusty and the surfaces had not been cleaned or wiped down. The main bathroom drain was really bad, we had to clean it ourselves. <br/>Zoe the cat (that comes with the stay) is adorable, all she wanted was some love and attention, though she’s not young and we did find ourselves worrying about her. We have 2 cats of our own so felt the need to be quite attentive to her. She needs medication on her food each morning and she definitely tells you when she’s hungry….and quite early in the morning too.<br/>The house was also a little cold (we stayed in July) and we weren’t sure if to use the heater or not as it looked quite old and not clean, it was gas so there was concern about it having been serviced. <br/>There was nowhere for the television to be plugged in on the wall where it was situated so we needed to stretch an extension cord across the living room. One of the mattresses was really old and should probably be replaced. The shower door doesn’t line up when it closes so you have to be careful with glass on glass, all the doors creak heavily and can use an oil. <br/>Some noise from the neighbours upstairs, from the street on some nights, from the shared garage door and from the raccoons trying to get past the box blocking the cat door means that the space may not be suited for a light sleeper.<br/>In summary, the space is lovely, has all that you need but does need some TLC and you definitely feel like you are in somebody else’s space."

That’s what happened when I stayed with Bruce and Alfredo, the charming couple who continued to delight and surprise me all the way through my stay. I arrived very late on a delayed flight and my luggage was lost for the first three days of my trip. But my first morning Bruce and Alfredo immediately started pulling things out of their closet to see what fit me and made sure I had everything I needed. The three of us ate breakfast together everyday (though it’s clear you are welcome to do your own thing too). They explained how to get everywhere, answered every question I could cook up, and even dropped me off at bus stations and helped me get a Clipper Card to ride on MUNI. They know this beautiful city in and out and clearly enjoy spreading the hospitality. <br/>Other big stand outs that put this place far above the average Airbnb: Alfredo cooked pancakes and eggs on the weekend and even served fresh fruit. Coffee was at the ready as soon as I emerged from my room each morning. At the table, we exchanged stories and laughed and laughed and LAUGHED! They treated me like family from beginning to end. It was truly like visiting a warm, loving, hilarious pair of uncles who dote on you. Their custom built house is stunning, peppered with beautiful pieces of glass art and original paintings on all three levels. It’s humming with zen vibes and smells great too. The outside space and the view are an amazing bonus. Not to mention, this was some of the best sleep I’ve ever gotten away from my own bed. The soft duvet and sheets made it feel like I was sleeping on a cloud. <br/>11 out of 10 stars. Is is too early to come back ??"

We were able to park our car in one of the parking spots every time we needed to. There are many people sharing the kitchen so it was often left with dirty dishes in the sink.  We found room in the fridge for our food but the freezer was pretty packed already, so it was difficult to fit our things in although we were able to.  There were multiple times I saw German cockroaches in the kitchen and in the bathroom, but we never saw them in our room.   We were on a tight budget for this trip so that my daughter could participate in a camp in SF.  The bargain price for this room made our trip possible, so I appreciate the value but I was worried about accordingly bringing roaches home with us and also was worried about sanitary conditions of the kitchen."

"5932","43369084",395667219,"683371474153506171",12,3,"Stayed with a pet","Upon check-in, finding which room was ours turned out to be confusing. There are three air bnb rooms located on the left side of the house, each labeled with a different letter. I checked my reservation to see if there had been a unit letter to help us distinguish which was ours, but I couldn’t find this anywhere in the reservation. So instead I tried each door because I didn’t know which one was ours. Finally I found ours, but it was definitely not ideal at first because I was concerned over disrupting other guests and my bf urgently needed to use the bathroom, so the slow check-in wasn’t what he had hoped for. The room was a lot smaller than I’d expected based on the pictures. The space was animal friendly which is why we chose it, but I don’t recommend if you have bigger dogs. We were fine, but two big dogs in this little room is not adequate space. Usually one of my pups sleeps in her crate, but she had to sleep in the bed with us because there was absolutely no way her crate would fit in there. Aside from this, the seating area outside looked like it was under construction or renovation with caution tape surrounding it and what looked like a bit of a mess outside. It was mostly concrete in the backyard, which was fine but our dogs didn’t really have anywhere to go potty for us to pick up. Not to mention the trash on the side yard was overflowing very badly. The recycling area was nice and clean, but we had no place to dispose of our dogs waste due to the overflowing trash. There seemed to be different projects in the backyard that were underway, so we were trying not to step on anything or get in the way. The last thing that seemed off was when I went to drink one of the two water bottles left for us, the seal seemed like it was broken. When I tasted the water it had the distinct taste of tap water. I looked at the other water bottle to see that the seal was still on that one. I broke the seal on the second one and tried it to see if it tasted different. I don’t know if I’m crazy, but I wouldn’t make a point to write about this in a review if I didn’t honestly believe that the first water bottle I drank was refilled with tap water. I want to give the benefit of the doubt but I was so freaked out by the waters that I couldn’t not say something. Needless to say we won’t be staying here again, mainly due to our dogs size. But the water bottles topped it off as the main reason. I could see this being fine for a solo traveler stopping by the San Jose area, but not for two people and two dogs, it just wasn’t cozy for us. Also our main reason for staying here was to find something affordable near Santa Cruz, which was about a 40 minute drive, so not terrible when you compare to other places in Santa Cruz going for over $400 a night for a basic hotel room."

We found everything we needed in the way of basic kitchen supplies. Noise was never a problem. Parking is on the street but we never had any difficulty finding a space. Dogs barking upon arrival might bother some people, but they quiet down quickly and we were never bothered. <br/>Two quibbles: a toaster would be a very useful addition to the kitchen, and one of two stools for eating at the counter dividing the kitchen from the living area had been pressed into service to replace a missing night table on one side of the bed."

Holly is very communicative and it is easy to access the location. There's a nice back patio. The towels and sheets are due for an upgrade and the mattress isn't very comfortable. You also have to enter and exit via a garage which can be dark at night. Good enough for a few days though, especially with such a great location."

Upon my arrival, she gave me a tour of my little room with comfy twin sized bed and (down the hall) shared areas: two toilets; shower with sink; modern kitchen (including self-serve breakfast); living room with bookcases, art from around the world, table for dining with a view of the city; and lovely garden. When I arrived ill-prepared for the chilly, drizzly weather, Susan offered me her coat and umbrella, ever-alert to ways in which she could make her guests’ stay more enjoyable while respecting our varying needs for privacy. Ordinarily reclusive, I greatly enjoyed talking with Susan. 84-years-young, she seemed to be able to connect in meaningful ways with whomever crossed her path."

Michael had very thorough instructions and was easy to communicate throughout. We were able to find nearby parking and access the apartment easily right at check-in. The entrance is a little cramped given the SF architecture, so if you have tons of luggage it may be a challenge to get into the space and store it all. But for the single night we were in town, the location was super convenient for us to be able to get around and we appreciated how comfortable the bed and couch were to lounge on. Being two tall people from Brooklyn, we are used to navigating smaller apartments and found everything fairly easy to use. We didn't cook, but the kitchenette was well-stocked and clean. The bathroom got slightly humid but with the window open, bathroom fan, and Dyson fan on it stayed cool.

Specifically Cafe Reveille and Otra Mexican food. Sona was very nice and answered all my questions before and during our stay, she was responsive and did so in a timely manner. My cons…. Parking was not as easy to find every night we would have to drive 15-20 minutes looking for a spot. After walking the city all day and getting back tired this became an inconvenience. We thought it would be easier with our disabled placard, but it made no difference. We would park 1-4 blocks away. We stayed 6 days and needed fresh towels, unfortunately the host only provides one set per person for your entire stay 🥴 this was kind of gross, so I ended up purchasing towels. I normally don’t care if I’m able to wash them, but this bnb does not have this option and the laundry that’s on the corner had a 24 hour turn around. The house is a no shoe zone, so bring your indoor slippers if you don’t like walking barefoot. We honestly only used the house to rest, sleep and shower. Thank you for sharing your house!"

We got very clear instructions on how to find the place and on how to get in using an app on your phone. Moreover, Jason was very easy to contact for any questions. There are quite some steps to get to the front door, but it is also San Francisco. In the apartment we had a nice big bedroom and our own guest bathroom. For breakfast we could use anything available in the kitchen (including the fridge). At our arrival we had a nice glass of wine with Jason, and he gave us some very good recommendation on where to go and which restaurants to try. Overall, we had a very pleasant stay with free parking in the streets around the apartment."

Lots of spiderwebs around the unit both inside & out so beware if you are scared of spiders or getting bit. <br/>Sticking to the facts on this, the unit was not COVID-level disinfected clean nor was it even properly clean for regular airbnb standards before the pandemic. The unit did not seem like it had a proper, deeper cleaning in awhile. Spots that were easily in my eyesight were dirty: nightstand lamp, kitchen appliances, dust bunnies in several places, & couch. Besides the bathroom which seemed pretty clean, the rest of the unit had a superficial level cleaning. <br/>Don’t count on any of the toiletries for your stay: the handsoap dispenser in the bathroom was less than 1/5 full, only 1 new roll of toilet paper for 2 guests 2 nights, & no paper towels available to cleanup a spill. For those needing a kitchen during their stay, note that the fridge size is very limited. There was no drinking water available in the unit besides tap water which is fluoridated 👎🏻 <br/>If you are a light sleeper, sensitive to noise, or want privacy, this may not be the place for you. Being below the thin wall of where a family lives, there was consistent noise from 8am-10pm. Also for prolonged periods of time there were louder, strange noises during the daytime. In the bathroom, you can hear conversations. I’m sure this is typical of SF too though.<br/>For 2 guests this is a spacious stay,<br/>On a lighter note, the unit is a spacious stay for 2 guests that also fit my tall partner (6ft3). The bed was very comfy & big! Having a parking spot was very nice in the stressful driving city of SF! Amenities like the TV, plug-in fan, plug-in heater was helpful to our stay.<br/>Thank you to Maury for being communicative & helpful during our stay. Just know you will run into the host as they live right above. Overall we did enjoy our trip 🤘🏻"

It was beautifully prepared for our 12-day stay. <br/>There was ample room for our family of four (including two teenagers) and every room was thoughtfully and so comfortably arranged. It is clearly a very well loved and cared for family home that works brilliantly as an AirBnB for that very reason. <br/>The house is on a steep block - which Peggy was very clear about before confirming our booking - but this meant that the views out of some of the windows were stunning. Sitting in the back sitting room at any time of day watching the fog come in over Twin Peaks was always a lovely experience. <br/>Peggy could not have been more helpful and welcoming. She and Pete were so kind and thoughtful with the information and guidance they gave about the house, the neighbourhood and the City more generally. <br/>We had the most wonderful stay at Peggy’s house and would be thrilled to visit again one day.

It was quiet and in a charming neighborhood a couple minute walk from places to eat. it was a 15 minute bike ride to downtown, close to a Whole Foods, and great access to The Alameda. The shower was very small and I had to turn the water off while in it because there wasn't space to really get out of the way of the water even a little while in it. There was a mini-fridge and a note to leave any used dishes at the foot of the stairs to be replaced, which was nice. I gave this place five stars because it was as advertised and the hosts were super responsive. If you want a full size fridge to stock up or a roomy shower/bathroom, this may not be ideal. But for me it worked as a good place to sleep and for conveniently getting to key places.

The design and furnishings were nice and gave us a wow moment when we first arrived.  The location is amazing and had everything we needed within a few blocks:  lots of places to eat and drink, convenience and grocery stores, BART and Bus access, and you can get around to a lot of other neighborhoods by walking, which we enjoyed.  <br/>A few opportunities to mention:<br/>1) Front bedroom with 2 singles and trundle can get street noise, especially over the weekends, i.e., heard a couple arguing/fighting and you could hear everything that was said.  Overall, the street is fairly quiet though for the such a dense city.  My sister is from Seattle and volunteered to take the front room as she stated that she was used to city noise, but I did not want them sleeping on singles.  The other 2 bedrooms are quiet.<br/>2) WIFI barely works in the living room and kitchen.  The router is in the front BR and WIFI signal does not reach the back.  Not sure that Eliza would approve, but we were able to move the router into the hallway without unplugging it, and the cables fit under the door.  Eliza’s description does statethis issue, but did not understand how much of an incovinenece it would cause everyone.<br/>3) Had a couple of issue pop up during our stay: 1) small water leak in the BR ceiling and hallway.  Eliza said she could have an emergency plumber address it or she could get it resolved after we left.  We chose the latter as the leak only occured once.  2) Dishwasher did not work and she gave us ~2 week notice about it, but no discount, 3) Freezer iced over and was not usable during our stay.<br/>I would have given 5 stars but gave 4 stars because of issues 2 and 3.  I am sure Eliza will address these 2 problems that will make the stay that much better for future guests."

The living room and kitchen are disconnected by a few steps outside. The spot is absolutely breathtaking and they have an amazing view of the city. The place is tastefully decorated and very cozy. We loved the mini fire place! The place was spotless, fresh, and clean. We loved the little details made by the hosts such as wine, a mini cheese board, and robes in the restroom. My fiancé and I were so sad that we had to leave but we would definitely rebook and recommend this place to others. Also it’s such a fair price for what you get. They were great hosts and communicated well. Things to note is that there are stairs leading down to the rooms and parking can be hard on the street but they let us park in their drive way during our stay which helped so much!"

To start the room is awash is natural sunlight that is further enhanced by high ceilings which invites the outside into the space. You get a wonderful view of the sky, trees and rooftops / buildings from any seat in the unit - comfortable bed, dining table or couch. The gorgeous bathroom alone is worth the entry fee. It's bright, modern and equipped with a rain shower that makes this far and above one of the best bathrooms on Airbnb. Doesn't matter that the space is kitchenless because you are a few minutes walk from some of the best food the city has to offer. Street parking can be a challenge, but you'll find a spot eventually.

"6220","1487849",35392248,"689203081749111423",13,4,"Stayed a few nights","First off, Maury was very kind and hospitable. Definitely a 5-star host. With that said, I will give the pros and cons to this stay. <br/>The location in relation to SF is hard to beat. it's a short 5-10 minute drive to get around most places so this is a plus. however, parking in SF is absolutely horrendous (and that's coming from an LA native) so I wouldn't recommend driving if you can avoid it by staying closer in the area you want to be around. <br/>It was also a very comfortable stay. the bed we slept in was very comfortable and felt like home. 👌 the other bed my mom slept in and it was a futon/pull out sofa bed type (which was advertised) so no surprises there. my mom (65yrs old) slept on and had no problems with it.<br/>Be mindful that this is absolutely a shared space, so I'd recommend this for 2 people, maybe 3 max depending on who is going. one of the sleeping areas is shared with the kitchen and bathroom so fitting anything more than 3 people will make it feel really small (think of the bathroom usage).<br/>The last thing that I want to mention is parking. parking in SF in general is horrendous, so travelers beware of this detail if you are someone that plans to spend a lot of time in the downtown area and surrounding parts. as a result, the parking space that is advertised is very misleading imo. there is enough space to fit a car in what is designated for them, but it is by no means easy to park there. I'm from LA were LA parking can be pretty pretty bad as well so I'm an experienced parallel parker in even the tightest of spaces and I would not recommend this for anyone who isn't comfortable parallel parking in tight spaces. <br/>TLDR<br/>Pros:<br/>-location: close to everything in SF<br/>-good views<br/>-comfortable for 2-3 people, 4 might be a little small since it's a shared space for one of the sleeping areas<br/>-rain shower was nice<br/>-lots of hygiene products provided as courtesy<br/>-lots of kitchen amenities<br/>-iron and ironing board<br/>-easy check-in and out<br/>Cons:<br/>-parking (advertised, but not an actual space, so car renters beware)<br/>-no a/c (but alternative plug-in cooling and heating options are offered)<br/>-some maintenance was required (towel rack was broken, and fan for bathroom not working properly which caused a lot of condensation while showering)"

Eoin & Susie are very generous hosts - all soaps / condiments provided for, extremely responsive to any of our queries. We really enjoyed the vibe of 24th St - lots of shops / restaurants etc. However you do see some homeless people / rougher edges as you get closer to Mission Street.

We were concerned at first when we saw there was construction happening behind the house, but the place must be insulated extremely well because we could barely hear them!

Initially we were a little hesitant about a private room as we've had mixed experiences in the past, but Jack and Christina welcomed us into their beautifully restored home and made our stay in San Francisco very very special. The house is conveniently located just a short walk from multiple public transport options, the glorious Dolores Park and amazing boutiques on Valencia Street, in addition to all the amazing food the Mission District has to offer. Our room and private bathroom were immaculate, and we learned so much about the history of the house and more through our chats with Jack and Christina. <br/>We really loved our stay at Katz House, where it felt more like staying in a boutique bed & breakfast than an Airbnb, with insider tips from long time locals and many stories about the house's impressive art collection.<br/>If you have the chance to stay here, take it!

The location was  perfect for us, and we had a really easy time exploring the city! We felt perfectly safe coming to and from the flat.

I honestly couldn't have asked for a better experience for my first time in SF and California. Would highly recommend to anyone, and I really hope to stay with Gary again someday!"

The microwave in our room did not work and the staff replaced it in a matter of minutes. The only downside was no coffee maker in the room. Also, there is a body shop (I think) next door, so it was pretty noisy in our room, but it didn’t ruin our stay at all since we were only at the motel in the morning and then after 8pm."

Otherwise, the bed and bedding were super comfortable, the wifi worked great, and everything was nice and clean! Would definitely recommend :)"

Little touches like having tea and coffee there were really nice to arrive to.  Simone was very quick to respond and very accommodating letting us check in early. Although we made it work the bed situation didn’t match the descriptions on the listing which may be an issue for families. There was one big bedroom as described and one other small bedroom with a double bed. The other 2 beds were in the open living area and the wooden bed was not in any of the pictures or description. We also hadn’t appreciated the apartment was a basement but this may be a ‘lost in translation’ issue as it is described as ground floor which in England would be at road level.

On one hand it did the job, the house is big and the rooms are decent. On the other hand, the house is quite old and has bad plumbing. The sink in the kitchen leaks and we ended up getting charged for the leak even though we explained to the host that the plumbing was clearly not up to par (pipes exposed, etc). The host wanted to enter the house many times and on one occasion gave us just 10 minutes warning. The host did renovations while we were there that were super loud.

It was already super well equipped with pots , pans, dishes, trash bags, etc. and it was super easy to fall into a rhythm here. I loved the high quality amenities like the in unit washer/dryer and the TV.  The couch is also super comfortable, a lot of people that I had throughout the day to come and visit adored the couch. The apartment is so lovely and would definitely stay here again. <br/>The area this airbnb is in can get a little shady at times. If you go towards sixth street it can get a little sketch but on the fifth street side it’s a little better. I definitely would recommend if you are a woman living alone in this apartment to be careful here or carry around pepper spray and things. I had friends walk me home at night which was enough. Regardless of the locational issues, it’s a great location easily located near convenient bus stops, BART stations, and general interesting locations. <br/>As for the apartment complex itself, the building is fine. There’s lots of dogs which is nice! But also sometimes the dogs pee in the hallways and it gets a little stinky. <br/>Overall highly recommend Richards place! Had a great stay."

However, even in the height of August, it was relatively chilly--generally up to 20 degrees cooler than inland, and persistently foggy. This is a decent location for a very skilled surfer, but I wouldn't recommend this for families. The ocean currents are so strong, that even good swimmers can get sucked out quickly. I wish there was more of a warning about this before booking. As a former lifeguard/current triathlete, a big part of booking this was access to the ocean. But even in a full wet-suit & neon safety buoy, I was stopped from entering the water by an ocean safety team member who basically told me I was likely to die if I attempted to get in the water and recommended I try China Beach. (which is also fairly dangerous, but not as bad) He told me that the area directly in front of the closest beach access point, where two  currents collide (you can see the waves coming together sideways into a funnel) is the worst place in the city to enter the water."

The owner was always very responsive with any issue or questions I had.  I will say at times throughout the summer the home would get a little hot but the host was very responsive and ordered a fan which helped keep the home cool.  <br/>Highly recommend staying here if your in San Fran."

However, it’s only a short (~5-10 minute drive) from the Mission District where there’s lots of SF’s most excellent restaurants. Katie and Eric’s place is 2 blocks from Whole Foods which is super convenient for a quick grocery run. It’s also 5 minutes from Costco and Trader Joes and 10 minutes from Target. Overall, a great place for a long-term rental with excellent attentive hosts."

Rumesha was helpful, courteous, and timely in providing preparatory information. Our arrival went off smoothly.  Rumesha met us as planned, provided us with information about the apartment and local area.  We arrived late and she was helpful in having us locate a restaurant for a meal.<br/>The apartment was as advertised – clean and with all the promised accessories – most cozy.  A bottle of wine and sparkling water were very nice touches!  The apartment is in a wonderful location – quiet nice neighborhood and a three-minute walk to the Muni N line.  We used the N line and the public transport connections to access all the SF and Oakland locations we wanted to visit. A special treat is to take the line to the Irving Street location with many superb restaurants – some with a Muni stop opposite their door!<br/>The apartment was very comfortable.  We used the kitchenette to cook our breakfast every morning with several leisurely cups of coffee.  A great start to the day! The pull-out sofa bed worked very well.  The shower had plenty of hot water and shampoo, conditioner, body wash, and towels.<br/>Our last day was made most comfortable by our host asking us to stay past the checkout time. We had a red-eye flight to the East Coast.  This kind courtesy made our departure so much more comfortable.<br/>We would recommend this location heartily.  One additional recommendation:  You may wish to inquire from Rumesha about the microclimate in the area at the time of your visit before packing.  We did not do so and wish we had!  The local microclimate is a marvel of the SF bay area!"

The BART is also very close-by the apartment. Thank you Omar for a wonderful stay in San Francisco. We'll definitely come back!"

The house is an old beautiful one with about 30 steps leading up to 'the cave', a lovely little refuge. <br/>As pointed out by many others before, it is really small, which was totally ok for me travelling solo. What could easily be improved though is a little shelf or at least some hooks to store or hang up things. (The kind of open mini wardrobe outside this room would be accessible to other guests, so I did not use that.)<br/>Speaking of other guests - as it is an old house the walls are very thin so you can hear every word spoken in the adjoining room. Bring ear plugs. ;-)<br/>If you are sensitive to light (and draft), bring a scarf/towel and some gadjets to hang it in front of the window. Some macgyvering may improve the conditions of that room a lot.<br/>As mentioned in the ad, there is no communal kitchen, but a fridge and a microwave in the entrance hall, which is great. Unfortunately only plastic cups and paper plates are provided, so I needed to organise some pot to heat water for a cup of instant coffee or porridge. Actually left the pot there for future residents! <br/>I really enjoyed my stay and loved the place!<br/>Highly recommended!"

It's only a few blocks from my favorite restaurant area on Irving. It's close to the park and not far from the beach. It does have two steep steps down to get in. If you have a vehicle, the parking is plentiful and easy. If you're counting on public transit only, it's important to know that you have to navigate about four blocks of steep hills to get out of the area of the apartment to then walk to public transit.

"6911","6653474",93511645,"704452646881911604",13,4,"Stayed a few nights","This was a really tricky one to review. While the location is hard to beat and the price is reasonable the unit is badly in need of some basic care.<br/>The gate to access the unit is barely functional, and borderline hazardous considering how many pointy rusted screws are sticking out of it. The toilet seat looks like it’s about 100 years old. The already narrow pathway to the back of the house is made even more narrow by a big piece of wood that is just laying there. It was warm during the day so we opened the windows but there were no screens so bugs kept flying in. There’s no water filter in the unit, I lived in the Bay Area for two years and don’t know a single person who drinks straight from the tap. We tried to get the smart tv to stream from our phones for about 45 minutes before giving up and watching on an iPad for the rest of the weekend.<br/>I could go on but there’s too much. Every corner of the unit has something annoying that could be fixed quickly and affordably. It just kind of feels like they threw a bunch of stuff in a room and didn’t put any thought into comfort or function.<br/>That sounds pretty harsh and it is but I’m still giving it four stars because of the value proposition of staying in this neighborhood at this price is very attractive. If you’re just in town for a couple days and will be out a lot this is a good option but if you’re looking for something that actually feels livable I would recommend you look elsewhere."

A very quiet neighborhood: it’s a little farther to the stores and restaurants, but we appreciated the peaceful surroundings. Public transit in San Francisco is great.<br/>The “kitchenette,” though not its own room, has the capacity of a full kitchen.

There are also stairs leading to a storage area within the unit. Our young kids left the stairs alone, but I wanted to share as I understand it could lead to a stressful situation if young kiddos enjoyed exploring stairs and what they lead to an extra bit as it isn’t kid proofed of course. - But, on the other hand our kids made noise and such and I didn’t feel like we were going to “get in trouble” so that’s a plus for the unit with young kids.

I stayed for more than 4 months and was a bit annoyed by the location by the end. Not because I felt unsafe (as others wrote, it’s on the outskirts of Tenderloin, but there are no people camping directly at the front door), but because it can be a lot walking by the people from Tenderloin every day."

Glen Park는 시내와 거리가 있어 안전합니다.<br/>미국여행에서의 제일 큰 걱정은 안전이었습니다. 처음엔 비싸더라도 호텔에서 머물면서 시내를 구경하려고 했는데, 호텔은 유니언플라자/시빅센터 근처에 몰려있었고 너무 비쌌습니다. 여행하면서 느낀 것은 저녁시간의 시내는 홈리스가 많아 생각보다 위험하다는 점이었어요. Beth의 집은 주택가가 몰려있는 Glen Park에 있고, 그래서 시내에서 즐긴 뒤 10시경 귀가해도 귀가길이 안전했습니다.<br/>2. 그럼에도 가깝습니다.<br/>Bart는 지하철과 비슷합니다. 시내를 돌아다닐 때 가장 많이 다닐 Powell street나 Union plaza 등은 Glen Park에서 Bart로 13분정도 떨어져있습니다. 44번 버스를 타면 Golden Gate Park로도 바로 갈 수 있어서 여행하기에 편리한 위치에 있습니다.<br/>3. 숙소가 깨끗하고, 무엇보다 호스트는 친절합니다<br/>방은 혼자 지내기에 편리한 아담한 규모인데, 이전에 한국 게스트들이 많이 묵었다고 저를 만나 반갑다고 해주셨어요. 여기서 6일을 보내는 동안 매일같이 안부를 물어주고, 또 여행 팁도 물어봤을 때 친절하게 설명해줘서 여행에 큰 도움이 되었습니다.<br/>긴 미국 여정을 계획할 때, 출국 전날까지 숙소를 정하지 못해 매우 불안했는데 첫 숙소를 Beth의 집에서 보낸 걸 정말 정말정말 다행으로 생각해요. 미국에서의 Airbnb가 처음이라서 불안하다면, 자신있게 Beth의 숙소를 고르시라고 말씀드리고 싶어요.<br/>이 글을 읽는 분들에게 안전하고 즐거운 여행이 함께하길 바랍니다. Beth도 항상 행복하길 바래요. :)"

Living room was perfect to cuddle up in and watch a movie. <br/>Since it is the basement and in conjunction to the garage it can get a little muggy after showers or cooking. Opening the window just a bit to air out did the trick just fine. <br/>Also, if you’re a light sleeper you can here the noises of people walking upstairs. This wasn’t much of a problem considering i had my ear plugs, but just a heads up. I thought it was perfectly fine. <br/>Can get just a tad cold but there are two space heaters that worked wonderfully. <br/>Location is really nice. We ended up renting a car and I do not regret it one bit. It was easy to get around and although there is no parking right in front of the Airbnb the 15 min walk wasn’t bad. You just need to find parking that’s not 2 hr parking. Except on weekends. We found a spot right in front of the Airbnb on a weekend. <br/>I hope to stay here again in the future."

On arrival we met Peter who is the kindest, most genuine, and loving person we have ever met. You can tell that he cares deeply and dedicated his whole heart into the place. When meeting Peter he was mindfully wearing a mask and gave us a tour to make sure we were comfortable. He made our time there wonderful and can lovingly say that we left with new friends and warm memories. The location is in a great area that felt very safe with an impressive lock system that my friend and I both appreciated. They include all the essentials and even a snack basket for their guests! The kitchen is impressive and stocked with any tool you could need in a kitchen. The bathroom is also beautiful with great lighting and a nice, spacious shower. The bedroom is elegant, spacious, and comfortable. (I especially admired the Broadway posters on the wall signed by each cast!) There is also a window in the bedroom that looks directly into their magnificent and serene backyard which sets the best vibes every morning. The living room is warm, comfortable, and homey. (My friend adored the fireplace!) There is also a surround sound TV system with so many movies to choose from, as well as streaming services. We only wish we had stayed longer!

Every morning there was piping hot coffee, muffins and fruit just outside our door.  Every morning, the hosts offered us their extensive knowledge of the city to tap into.  From restaurant recommendations to travel tips, these guys were on point.  For my partner’s birthday, they surprised us with birthday cupcakes and decorations.  On the day we got flat tires on our bike, cheer up snacks and greetings awaiting us. These guys really care about their guests in every possible way, and it shows with every gesture and act they undertake.<br/>Bruce and Alfredo have a gorgeous home which they opened to us to share.  Wonderful artwork to take in and beautiful handblown glass pieces to behold.  We were able to make eggs for ourselves and eat in their beautiful dining room. The front sitting room was great for late night tea.  The real highlight however was the garden.   We spent a lovely afternoon there chatting with the boys, enjoying the birds dipping in the babbling fountain, watching the hummingbird’s sipping nectar, taking in the fragrance of the lemon tree blossoms, and reveling in the beauty of the trumpet vines and other surrounding flowers.

Gigi's is close to Clement St (which has a wonderful bakery with the best croissant I've ever had) and Golden Gate Park (with wonderful museums). I wish we could have stayed longer! There's a garden in the backyard that your bed looks out over, and two friendly cats who may meow at you from the door if you're lucky. At one point, I stepped outside, and there were bees warming out of her beehives, butterflies fluttering around, and the most luscious rose bush I've ever seen. Indoors, the small apartment is cozy and wonderful. We loved getting to sit on the couch at the end of the day when our feet were worn out from all the walking and getting to watch one of the many VHS and DVDs she has stored on the shelf (yes, VHS! a very fun experience, haven't used one in forever). There's a small kitchen nook where you can enjoy the delicious breakfast she brings every morning at 8am, fresh coffee in a carafe (if you tell her you're a drinker), and... maybe not get internet. The internet works! Good WIFI. However, not in the kitchen nook. Head over to the living room/bedroom/small couch in the kitchen if you're having trouble getting signal. Other than that... enjoy your stay! There are books and board games in case you get bored or want to relax in the back garden, and all of San Francisco is only moments away."

The bathroom sink wasn’t properly cleaned, still had hair in it, the patio furniture had a thick coat of dirt and ants crawling all over them, coffee maker was dirty, mugs were dirty, and Wi-Fi was spotty which was bad for me because I booked this for a work trip thinking I can trust an Airbnb plus listing. I was told to """"""""move closer to the bathroom, that's where the router was"""""""".<br/>All that I can deal with, and did. The worst part of this experience was the host - this property is managed by a company called HostWell, they seem to think it's unreasonable of a guest to expect patio furniture to not be crawling with ants. It took them until day 3 of my stay to thoroughly clean the outdoor space. Because they were slow to respond  (again, really?! this is a plus listing??), I contacted airbnb customer service on my 2nd day there which seemed to have irritated Hostwell and prompted this company to send me a message accusing me of being inappropriate and asking me to never to book one of their properties again.<br/>Gladly Hostwell, gladly. I hope NO ONE ever books one of your properties again. I also hope hosts have the sense not to hire you anymore."

She kept a dedicated, guest refrigerator stocked with water and milk for coffee, and she provided multiple snacks, fruits, coffee and teas.

The main building had EVERYTHING for you to either rent or borrow, so ask if it’s available at the front desk first before you go out and buy. Wifi wasn’t great, but that’s not why you’re there. The staff was super nice and are there 24/7. <br/>We were in a private room about a block and a half from the main building, up an alleyway. This building is next to a school, so the mornings and pick up time were busy - if you’re trying to park anywhere. It was also a little up the street from the clubs, so it wasn’t overly loud, but I can imagine why parking here isn’t ideal. The block isn’t the best we saw in the city, but the location is very good with it being so close to Chinatown and North Beach food areas; we were able to easily navigate from here and didn’t feel too far removed from everything. <br/>(Paris Pizza down the block is good, but walk a block or two further and get Golden Boy Pizza and save money and tastebuds. Stinking Rose isn’t worth the money.)"

They provided us with multiple fruits, milk and cream, coffee, as well as snacks and breakfast items. Their were plenty of toiletries, towels, and sheets etc. The bedrooms were nice with great light and the beds extremely comfortable. With the windows in the front of the house open, it does get loud. Luckily, the host provided (new/packaged) earplugs which we didn’t end up needing. The house is shoe free, which we respected and you could tell the spotless nature of the house was dependent on this. You will not be disappointed with the neighborhood, and besides the crazy hills around, you will be astounded by the views.

We were able to easily find parking for our rental car. <br/>Our group of 4 was traveling for work, and we really enjoyed the privacy and comfort of the bedrooms, the great decks with city views, and the shared living room, kitchen, and dining room spaces for hanging out. They've thought of every detail in terms of comfort. The kitchen has every possible amenity you might need, and is stocked for a dinner party of your dreams. While the house clearly shows the care and individuality of being Julie and Brad's family home, it had the cleanliness, organization, and open spaces that you would expect of a professionally managed rental property.  <br/>Julie and Brad were staying on-site at the time in a separate apartment, and they were extremely responsive to every question we had. They also proactively saved a parking spot for us, and helped us out with a special request. At they same time, they were unobtrusive and very respectful of our privacy while we were there.  <br/>If this home is available, look no further - you should stay here!"

The apartment (including the kitchen) is fully equipped with everything you'd need for a short or long-term stay.  Stable, fast wifi for the entire stay.  Well-appointed, tastefully decorated.  And the back yard truly is an oasis, you couldn't ask for a better place to take in your morning coffee or an afternoon drink.    It's an easy walk to get to everything available in the heart of the Castro, and the walk back to the apartment isn't as bad as a San Francisco walk could be (only a little bit up hill)."

"7763","5572169",175019911,"724047522841989309",14,5,"Stayed about a week","Alison & Mark are wonderful hosts. I would normally book a hotel for a vacation, but in San Francisco the price for a nicer chain hotel is $300-500 a night!  I knew his wasnt worth it, and so we looked into motels and other rentals. They were reasonably prices, but some customer reviews werent so good. And I had a concern with bedbugs and excessive noise.<br/>When we stumbled upon this gem much more reasonable than a hotel, I decided to reach out. I wanted a nice, clean, quiet space to enjoy after coming back from experiencing the many San Francisco attractions. And its the perfect comfort spot to relax on rainy days. There is a beautiful deck right outside to enjoy a meal and watch all the ppl cross the golden gate bridge. The sunrise & sunsets over the bay are simply gorgeous.<br/>The suite had everything we needed. A small refridge, microwave, utensils and plates to warm up leftovers. The Bottled water was an extra perk in the room to fill up a water bottle and take it for the day, or drink at mealtime. We didnt have to worry about anything. The extra closet place in the hallway provided extra blankets, towels, toiletries, and wipes to clean up/sanitize surfaces. There were other guests staying in a room across from ours, and everyone was respectful of noise andcpersonal space. The hosts lived the floor below, but stayed behind the scenes doing their own thing, but always close enough should we need anything or ask a question. They have lived in the area for quite some time, and made some really nice recommendations for dinner & getting around the city. Alison even mentioned a Gap nearvy in which I needed to purchase warmer pants for this visit lol. The hosts took the time to meet us when we first arrived. They are great people who really know what they are doing. They think of everything a guest would need and beyond. The space was clean & beautiful, better than even a top notch hotel. Best decision we ever made when visiting San Francisco when you already are stressed and unsure what to expect.<br/>We appreciated being able to leave our suitcases after checkout, as we wanted to see a few last minute things in the city. As we waited on the outside steps waiting for our Uber to the airport, another couple came and we told them they were going to love it!<br/>Alison & Mark are beyond Superhosts. This is the perfect example of how an airbnb is supposed to be. I would recommend this place to anyone coming to the city. Its a very safe, quiet neighborhood with a small grocery, laundromat, and quite a few options close by for dine in dinners.<br/>The only thing when determining whether to stay here is wheel chair accessibility. There are quite a few stairs going up a spiral staircase, but Im sure the hosts would try and accommodate for disabilities as best they could. It is their home, and we realize it has its limitations, so I am just mentioning it as an fyi for other travelers.<br/>We could have asked for better here, best airbnb/sublet/vacation rental Ive ever experienced!!!!"

In addition the kitchen is well stocked with every conceivable spice!<br/>Jenn and Gary were very gracious hosts—greeting us upon arrival and accommodating any special needs we had—including some flexibility during checkout when we were delayed due to a car rental glitch. They were very quick to respond to any questions or requests (such as an iron, thanks Jenn ;-)<br/>We appreciated the comfort of their home which allowed for a relaxing stay in a beautiful city.

The artist's loft is a wonderful place to stay in terms of all the usual criteria - it is exceptionally clean, a great location, has all the amenities you need - but it is much more than that. It has been built and designed by the owners with incredible attention to details and marvelous features and flourishes like wooden doors to the bedroom that come from Jaipur, India. You can also view several of the owner's public artworks in San Francisco, making it an experience rather than just a place to stay. Loved it."

The check-in and check-out process was simple and the place was beautiful.  However, I worked with Bill directly to coordinate the stay and he was sometimes hypervigilant of our guests and, although he was not physically present, the abundance of notes throughout the property listing various house rules was noted by our guests to be somewhat imperious.  Regarding hypervigilance, my husband and I met with our guests at the property to coordinate airport drop-off and regroup, which took perhaps a 10- to 15-minute visit in total, with no visits, parties, or overnight stays throughout the reservation period.  Within the hour, Bill messaged me to say, """"""""I see from the building video cameras that there are 6 people in the home"""""""" referring to myself, my husband, and our four guests, as well as a reminder of his guest policy.  After receiving a message he watched us on camera, it felt a bit violating and unsettling, especially as my husband and I had left shortly after visiting his residence.  Although the residence was spacious, centrally located, and held stunning views, the seemingly overbearing nature of his hosting style felt very unwelcome and somewhat stressful following our wedding weekend."

The town is cute and is close to a grocery store, some local eateries and bars.<br/>Our trip started with bags getting delayed with the airline for 11 hours. We got in and grabbed lunch at Bernal Star right next to the house. Mary let us check in a little earlier than 4pm. Mary was excellent with her communication and clear instructions which she sent days ahead of our stay so we were very prepared. The home was prettier than the pictures.<br/>There is a set of stairs you must climb before you reach the rooms, if you're carrying heavy luggage you may want to be cognizant of it. There is a skylight that shines on the center of the dinner table which is beautiful. <br/>The kitchen is stocked with fruits, bread, butter,jelly for toast as well as cereal and oatmeal and of course teas and coffee which is very thoughtful and not all AirBnBs provide it.<br/>The floors can be creaky but Mary provides slip on slippers to help with the noise. The bedrooms have black out curtains and she also provides ear plugs which is a nice touch. The beds are super comfy and I slept well both nights. Ample bath towels and wash cloths and shampoo, conditioner, body wash for use. <br/>Mary also has pictures on all the bins to help with segregation of garbage as per San Francisco's laws. <br/>My parents were super comfortable with the stay and so I give this stay 5 stars all around.

This home is well connected to the SFO buses, MUNI, BART. The BEst way is to download the MUNI app on your phone and buy the tickets. a Day pass is $5 and u can use it all day across the city. I just used g-maps public transportation option to find all the buses to go everywhere. The BART takes you outside the city. I used that and Caltrain as well.

The cottage is tucked away behind the main house on a quiet street in Menlo Park, only a 10-15 minute drive from downtown Redwood City or downtown Palo Alto.<br/>The cottage was adorable, comfy, and well stocked. Since this was a longer stay, I appreciated having a full kitchen and being able to cook my own meals, many of which I enjoyed on the tiny outdoor porch. Anja took care of many thoughtful details, including stocking the bathroom with various essentials and providing some breakfast items for the first few days of the stay.<br/>I occasionally worked remotely from the cottage and the wifi was great - no issues at all during multiple Zoom calls. <br/>Would highly recommend Anja's property for one or two people visiting the area or looking for a longer term stay!"

Definitely a great deal considering the cost of other places nearby.

We had no issues with the street parking (always parked right outside the main house, with almost no others cars in sight). The traffic does pick up during morning and evening rush hours, so there can be some noise, but never enough to be intrusive. So nice to have a washer and dryer for our road trip clothes, a huge fridge, and a full-sized tub for uncramped bathing, showering, and leg shaving. We loved that Alice's checkout process was so simple -- just turn off the lights and heat and lock up the place! To get to the apartment from the street, you'll have to go up a flight of wide concrete steps, so just a heads-up for those with heavy suitcases."

There were restaurants just up the road that had delicious cappuccinos and plain croissants (thats my fav breakfast). Lots of other breakfast options too.

Néanmoins, je me suis sentie safe tout le temps : les rues du quartier financier sont bien éclairées le soir pour rentrer, il y a toujours du monde dans la salle commune ou à l'accueil, et globalement personne ne vient nous déranger si on veut rester tranquille.

It's part of a backyard area that is green and lush - a hidden oasis in the middle of San Francisco.  There are multiple areas to set up shop with your laptop and coffee and work.  This oasis is behind a locked gate with fences all around, making it particularly safe.<br/>If you happen to be walking to the office districts in SOMA (e.g. on Brannan) from Kepa's location, as I was, I can say that the walk was very safe.  I took two different paths, and both times there was activity and foot traffic, including when I walked it at around 9PM.  Of course it's important to have your wits about you no matter where you are in San Francisco, but this location and surroundings are on the safer end.<br/>Beyond that, Kepa is a very personable host (and person !).

"8106","212783",46808539,"733455594471126400",15,5,"Stayed a few nights","This is a very good value. It felt a bit like a hostel because you have to share a bathroom. It is an very old house that hasn’t been updated for polish. That said beds and linens were very comfortable. I had a table and chairs, dresser with three way mirror and a refrigerator. There aren’t a lot of plugs that aren’t being used but that is to be expected and I had enough. A heater and lots of blankets were provided and they were plenty. The neighborhood felt safe, a block off Haight, I walked through the neighborhood several times back to my room at night. I would recommend if you are on a budget and want to be in the middle of the city. You are pretty equidistant to everywhere and public transit is easily accessible."

Low pressure of the water stream in the shower. It was chilled outside but we could warm ourselves in the shower. it was also very difficult to wash a head.

I appreciated the advance communication from Kelly with information about how to access the space, as well as recommendations for nearby things like restaurants, shops, etc. The location is great - quiet, walking distance to some things with public transit stops close by. I really appreciated the use of the laundry machines as I'd already been traveling for a week prior to arriving here. I also loved the natural light and the deck, though it was on the chillier side when I visited so I didn't get to enjoy the deck as much as I'd have liked.<br/>For anyone who has trouble with stairs this may not be the space for you as there are a lot of them. I could also hear the TV or people talking (couldn't make out actual conversation) in the other rental a couple nights but it wasn't too bad and it wasn't disruptive to my stay.<br/>I only rented a car for one day because I didn't need it otherwise. Parking wasn't available outside the house but I did find a spot that was only a block and a half away or so.<br/>Overall this is a great space and I'd love to stay here again the next time I'm in town."

His kitchen is like a farmer's market. <br/>We share very nice story and ideas, I really feel connected to Mark. <br/>I have to mention the bedsheet is silk and gave me two perfect night of sleep.

We were located only a 15 min walk from Ghirardelli Square (downhill) and directly next to a MUNI stop (for getting back again). The surrounding neighborhood was very safe and quiet, and we felt completely at ease walking down to the wharf. I highly recommend walking to Fort Mason, and from there to Ghirardelli Square, Fisherman Wharf, Pier 39, and then catching a water taxi to the Ferry Building. MUNI took us directly back home again from there! There was dedicated parking at the hotel (which can't be overstated!) and even though we checked-in quite late there was someone there to take care of us and get us situated. Only small detraction was some of my group said someone on the property was quite loud once or twice during our two night stay. I was wearing ear plugs (as I usually do when I sleep somewhere new) and so didn't notice or wake up. Our accommodations were clean, comfortable, and as advertised, and came with the soap/shampoo etc that you would expect. Overall a great stay!"

The rental is quite large and has an excellent layout with plenty of light. It was equipped with everything we needed, and having a dedicated washer/dryer and garage space was heavenly.

We stayed ten days but were disappointed with some of the facilities.   One small table and one chair is not enough if you wish to have a take away etc.   There was also a couch and small armchair in the room.   We found the room to be very noisy.  The heat came on at 6.00 am and always woke us as the heat blew through a vent above the bed.   We could also hear every movement overhead from the main house e.g. creaking floorboards, water flowing, chairs/table moving.   Disappointed there was no kettle, there was a coffee machine but I do not drink coffee and would have liked to be able to make a cup of tea.    Miriam left us a lovely cake and told us where we could get clean towels.  While the bathroom was very small, no shelf on which to leave toiletries, there was plenty of hot water for a shower.  I am only writing this review because I believe its important to know these facts before booking."

Super close to two MUNI bus stops and also the Trolley.<br/>The host is very responsive and helped resolve some hiccups very quickly and efficiently!<br/>The house itself is pretty nice. The Master Bedroom gets a lot of natural light, but the other rooms tend to not get much. Central heating makes it cozy and comfortable in the winters, but it might be useful to have a fan if you’re here in the summer because it can get hot (no AC). There’s lots of storage space all around.<br/>The house is pretty well-equipped in the kitchen, which I appreciated very much. <br/>It’s unfortunately quite hard to find street parking (and it also requires a permit), so we had to park in a garage a 5m walk away. This is true for most of SF though :)<br/>Overall had a very pleasant stay!"

You won’t regret it 😊 My husband and I had the most wonderful stay for our first visit to San Francisco. The location is perfect! The neighborhood is beautiful, very safe and quiet. It’s fairly close to all the main tourists spots with easy access to public transportation (bus stop is 1.5 blocks away) but far enough away to escape from the busy crowds. There’s lots to see and do within walking distance. Mimi and Mosh are so lovely and helpful! They make you feel so welcome and gave us some great suggestions on things to do and places to eat. The suite itself was perfect for us, small but cozy. Everything is exactly as pictured. Very clean and comfortable. There is a beautiful garden outback to enjoy and the private entrance made it easy to come and go throughout the day. Mimi and Mosh have literally thought of everything to make sure their guests are taken care of. We had everything we could have possibly needed and more. If we ever get the chance to come back, we would stay here again in a heartbeat!"

Parking gets tricky since you’re in a neighborhood so prepare to park down the street or get home earlier. The rental unit comes with a partial kitchen which wasn’t pictured at the time of my booking. There is no stove, but there is a microwave and toaster oven, both of which have seen better days. The cleaning fee isn’t too pricey, but it’s evident because the dining chairs had footprints on them, the couch looked sunken in, and the floors were not swept good. Luckily there was a bottle of Lysol that we utilized to wipe everything down, from the chairs to the toilet seat. My favorite part was probably the bathroom because it was long in space, however everything else was just okay. The listing mentioned a gaming console and a heater, both of which was not accessible. There was a controller but no console, and the heater turned on at night without our control. Overall I’d say this stay was average so don’t expect a luxury experience. 3.5 out 5 from me."

The room was not the most fancy or luxurious but it was clean and the bed comfortable. I had room #4 and it had a little front room with a table where I could have a quick breakfast (just some bread, no cooking possibility in the room) and plan my activities for the day. The shared bathroom was simple but clean. Only one other room on the floor, so no waiting line. Most of all, the location is perfect for a stay in San Fransisco with lots of happening near by and Golden Gate Park a quick walk away. I never had to ask for anything, so I never had to contact Josh but I am sure he would have responded quickly if something was not as it should have been."

We worked remotely without any issues and slept soundly at night.<br/>Finally, if you need to cook while you are here, both the mini-fridge and microwave worked well. Sylvie had left some treats that we could help ourselves to, and it is also only a block from Trader Joes.<br/>One PSA, for anyone with mobility issues, the entrance to the apartment is down a sloping path behind the gate. This would not be a problem for most people, but my wife had an injured knee at the time so had to take extra care."

Communication was easy, as was check in and out.<br/>Cons:<br/>The apartment only has one pair of plates and cutlery (no dishwasher), so this meant a lot of washing up on lazy days with multiple meals inside. This is easily fixed by the owner though. The location of the apartment is a bigger issue. In the past couple of years the homelessness problem in the area has exploded and seeing people slumped on the sidewalk taking drugs is an every day occurence. My partner did not feel safe going out alone, especially in the evening. The smell of some of the streets is also very off putting and I think we'd likely stay elsewhere next time. None of this is the fault of the homeowner and not something they can fix, but something you should keep in mind for potential stays in the near future."

Cindi kept her home spotless, her cupboards organized, and those plush sheets in the guest room, freshly laundered. Everything about her home felt warm and cozy, which was perfect for this SoCal native who wasn't used to the brisk San Francisco mornings and evenings. <br/>As a busy graduate student who liked to  meal prep for the week, I loved using her beautiful Viking stove in her spacious kitchen. And I greatly appreciated how Cindi seamlessly made room for my pantry items and fresh produce in her refrigerator. Additionally, as an avid cyclist, I was also grateful that she helped accommodate safe storage of my road bike, during the week.  And as a newcomer to the city, I loved the proximity of her home to a little bit of everything: supermarket, restaurant, the Marina, the local farmer's market on Saturdays, the Palace of Fine Arts, and so much more.

I could 100% recommend it, i hope to come stay there myself soon again."

Location is great, with many transit options nearby, and Valencia St. (countless restaurants/bars) just a couple of short-blocks away.

Es una habitacion con baño y muebles de cocina sin ser una cocina.

Solo 1 hora al dia! Y si alguien mas del edificio ya la usa a esa hora no podras.<br/>La primera noche hacia Mucho frio y no encontramos ningun termostato para regular la temperatura, enviamos un mensaje a la amfitriona y ni nos contesto, solo conecto la calefacció por aire a distancia, parece que se molesto por decir que hacia frio, pero tubimos que dormir con Jersey ya que no se calento hasta media noche. <br/>Si vais en coche NO es recomendable, un dia pasamos casi 1 hora buscando parquing.

There was one night where I accidentally left the keys at the airbnb and didn't realize until we had arrived back after midnight. I messaged her and before we knew it, she was opening her front door for us. I honestly cannot say enough good things about her and her property.

Aside from the neighboring gentlemen’s clubs, the location was great, convenient to most tourist destinations and just a short walk to the bus stop (public transportation is great in SF!). The building is old and it has a lived in feel, not a cold sterile feel most hotels have. The room was small, but that was expected. The room was not on the main road so it was relatively quiet and it had a window we could open during the day for fresh air which was nice. Bathrooms were right across the hall and we rarely had to wait. The kitchen was well stocked and the communal spaces were comfortable for a meal or game of jenga."

There is a coffee shop and bakery close by and the beach is just a little farther down, about 15-20 mins walking in total.

There are two separate areas: Bedroom/bath and Living/Kitchen, both of which are nicely decorated and well stocked.  The two areas are separated by a wooden deck with an awesome view of Twin Peaks!  We wish we had been there during a time we could have sat out on the deck and enjoyed the view!  We did enjoy the hosts' welcome goodies.  The heating in both areas works very quickly.<br/>I would say that if you have mobility issues, this place might be a challenge for you as there are about 20 steep stone steps from the street level down to the unit.  Also, at the time of year we stayed (November) the wooden deck was often slippery due to rain/dew from fog.<br/>Driving up the hill to the unit can also be a challenge as the roads leading up are very narrow and winding.  I would not recommend arriving after dark (which we did due to flight schedule) because navigating to the place the first time is difficult in the dark.  Luckily, Joel met us when we arrived and helped us with luggage and making our way down the steps.<br/>We enjoyed our stay and would recommend it with the above caveats."

The unit is quiet and very clean, though the furnishings are older, they are generally in good condition. The bathroom has been renovated, and the fixtures are more modern. We did not use the stove, but it looks like an induction stove, for which there are pots and pans. There is a drip coffee maker, microwave, and refrigerator as well. The wifi worked well. The best part of the rental is the very friendly owners, who meet you when you arrive, and explain where everything is in the unit. They were available throughout the stay, as they live in the separate upstairs unit. They even sent us messages asking if we needed anything. They also provided fresh fruit, bottles of water, and ground coffee- all nice touches."

Over the years there have been some updates, leaving the house a bit funky. Decor is dated, the kitchen was not inviting to cook in (we were a party of 7 and chose to eat out each meal). But Myles is a caring host and check in and check out were seamless. Overall we had a good time."

Many shops and restaurants nearby and you can get to other areas of interest very easily.<br/>2. Scott is a terrific host and was great at responding to all of our requests.  His communication was immediate--in the interest of full disclosure, the rear window of the rental car we (which was parked in the driveway) had was smashed by what we presume were vandals looking for a quick steal.  Scott was great at referring us to a neighbor for video footage. However, we never felt unsafe and attributed this to just petty crime that can<br/>happen in any large US metropolitan city.  <br/>3. The house itself was very easy to navigate and very livable.<br/>The only other observation for others is that this is Scott's primary residence.  We found it different from other AirBnB rentals we have used since the house had the owners possessions everywhere.  That may not be important for many but it was a bit strange to have little closet space and almost no cabinet drawers to store things plus a pantry covered with the owners food."

Not only did it make our almost daily trips to UCSF easy (not even a 5 minute drive!), but it’s also perfectly situated for all kinds of walks in nature - close by local parks, close by Golden Gate Park and even the beach is just a short drive. You just have to drive down 9th Ave. towards Golden Gate Park to get to all the restaurants and food you want.

The kitchen was well-equipped and easy to work in; beds were super comfortable; many thoughtful extras such as robes and slippers were supplied.  I appreciated the communication we received before & during our visit about where to park, how to access the home, local transit options, & the check-out process. The messages were paced so you received each block of information right before it was needed; that kept things from being overwhelming. The Bernal Heights neighborhood is like a small village; it's very walkable, and we enjoyed walking several times in Bernal Heights Park which is not far away & has fantastic views of the city. My only challenge was noise at night from the street in front of the home; the earplugs thoughtfully supplied helped but didn't block the noise as much as I would've wished.

She tucks her things away and her place is very clean, but expect the fridge and bathroom shelves/drawers to not be empty.

He gives the BEST recommendations and tips. In addition to this, he gives great life advice and has so many great stories to share with you to make your trip even more memorable. He is also an amazing vegan cook (I think chef level personally) and I have learnt so many new recipes from him as a vegetarian myself. He is clean, friendly, hospitable, fun and just an all round good person. Thank you so much Mark for making this trip one I will remember forever. You have given me a new meaning of San Francisco.

A block away from a million shops and restaurants on Haight Street - mostly quirkly hippy or hipster type places.<br/>Not negatives, but know that you will be climbing a fair amount of narrow stairs if you stay on an upper floor. The mattress is fairly firm memory foam and I wasn't a fan, but that's just my personal preference. I would caution about the bed frame corners because I hit my shins and toe against them a couple times due to their proximity to the walls.<br/>The heater in the room worked well and quickly. The bathroom was very close to the room. It was clean and witha shower/bathtub. It was a cold at night and in the morning.

Both were an amazing duo that were approachable when needed (although the place had everything we needed)<br/>Parking was excellent. When we went, there were tons of open spaces. We parked right in front of the place, and it definitely made me feel secure to leave my car. The whole neighborhood felt extremely safe. In terms of driving my car around the city, this place is definitely central and convenient (15 mins to major places, except GG Bridge). <br/>Inside there were extra towels, and an extra blanket.

He helped me access entrance remotely and differently than I had been instructed, and he reported that Michael was in the hospital, and that I could call or text him any questions. I texted a question once and did not receive a response and did not pursue it further. I did not find dishwasher detergent or shampoo in the apt.

Our room was very small and did not have an adjoined bathroom, which we had to access via the hallways; however, there are plenty of private, though also small, bathrooms with showers. I imagine the other rooms don't have adjoining bathrooms, seeing as this is a hostel. If you need space, quietness after 10pm, and privacy, then you might not enjoy staying here. NOW, for THOSE of us who adapt and thrive in all spaces, among all decibals, and surrounded by community, then you will really like this spot. I took an impromptu mother-daughter trip with my 9-year old, and we had a blast. We even played pool in the rec room. Everyone was super nice, which is a big deal because kids are not always enjoyed by others.

I wanted a place that was in the city that had ample parking and a full kitchen. You get both and more for a very good price! The space is homey and comfortable. My partner and I were very satisfied. We both appreciated the morning snacks, coffee, cooking supplies, and good eats recommendations. Bed also very comfortable. Large size bathroom. <br/>Things to consider place is on a hill. I liked how parking it at a 90 degrees (which I prefer as opposed to parallel parking on a hill). Also, space says it can be for 3 people. Make sure you all don’t made being in each others space and company since it is a studio. My partner and I (two people) felt it was enough space for us given a studio. Also, because of the hills after a long day of walking all over SF we decided to Uber back to avoid walking various hills. <br/>Overall highly recommend!!!

The price, location, and host are the best. This is at the top of our list for all future travel to San Francisco."

Noe Valley is a quiet neighborhood walkable to lots of restaurants and shops (but be ready for a hill workout). Close to Mission as well and drive-able to the rest of San Francisco's sites. The space is simple but comfortable and clean. It's on a quiet street and we were able to find parking (again note that SF is hilly and it sits on a steep hill). Bathroom is small but has what you need and the bedroom is huge and well furnished. <br/>Also Mark is a great communicator and let us check in early which really helped us out."

We were enchanted by the spectacular views of the Golden Gate Bridge and the open space of Marina Green just around the corner.  Within walking distance, too, were the bars and restaurants of Fort Mason and Chestnut Street. Parking was never an issue, nor was procuring an Uber when needed. We felt safe enough to let our teenage son and daughter explore the neighborhood a bit on their own. Beth was an incredibly thoughtful and responsive host, and the apartment itself was infused with a vitality, sense of humor, warmth, and positive energy that are hallmarks of a life eagerly and kindly led. We loved that there was enough room for each child to have a separate space and for us to have the tranquillity of a private basement suite with a charming patio.  We loved it as the ideal setting from which to launch tours of regional parks and universities. Can't wait to return!"

Melissa and Nicole had it perfectly laid out with everything you need. It felt very comfortable and is super quiet. The neighborhood is adorable and walking distance to everything. There is a very cute patio connected to the room that is nice to sit outside (weather permitting). There was a slight hiccup with check in (code was wrong) but the hosts were quick to respond and fix the situation.  I absolutely loved the space, the bed was comfortable, the personal touches were great ( coffee, tea, hot chocolate, TV with cable and streaming services like Netflix).  I will definitely be back!"

Communication in advance was excellent. They checked in several times during our stay to make sure all was good.  They have a detailed manual with loads of helpful information.<br/>The location is good if you are looking for an in city location.  A Muni street car stop is a few doors away.  On street parking was sufficient for our rental car.  SFO is only 25 min away, depending on traffic.   A hub to explore the city, can’t imagine how you could beat it."
